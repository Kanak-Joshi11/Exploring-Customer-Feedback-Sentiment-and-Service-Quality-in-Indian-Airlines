Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangalore to Paris via Delhi,2024-08-01,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   Had a flight on 31 August from Bangalore to Paris with a stop in Delhi. Although the connection was 3h appart, and the Air India personell assured me that the baggage will be forwarded in Delhi, hey did not manage to do that. I am now 24 days latter, after 10's of calls and several tickets opened still not in the possesion of my luggage. Air India knows nothing, all they suggest is rasing another ticket. As the others I already have are closed. Not that anyone even contacted me once to tell me something. The sheer incompetence of this airline is incredible. I will take a moment here also to speak about the flight itself: aircraft dirty, not a little dirty but dirty in a gross way, like it was cleaned the last time a few years ago. Entertainment wise, 50% of all screens in the aircraft were not working, the ones that did had headphones issues, the perfect environment to spend 9h. This was the last time that I will buy a ticket from them and I really advice everyone else to not look at a couple of dollars difference and save yourselves hours of headaches. Customer support is inexistant, they answer, they barely speak english and all that they do is open tickets that they close themselves probably to look good in statistics as none of my tickets got any answer, or at least an automatic email saying that your ticket is closed. You just wait like an idiot and nothing happens.",Indigo,2024,8
Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Amritsar via Delhi,2024-09-01,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,1.0,"   I had the worst experience with Air India.  I had 2 carry-on bags, and both of them were lost during handling by airline. By the time, I received them I was missing all my money and valuables. When I made a complaint about it it was just a waste of my time, Delhi team was useless and instead of helping they give you headaches. No one take responsibility, that is main part which making airline zero. If you are reading my review I will say spend $50 extra and book other airline at least you will have peace of mind.",Indigo,2024,9
Business,Business Class,London to Delhi,2024-09-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,10.0," My husband left his passport at home and is flying Air India 16/09/24. The staff at check in desk kept on pushing for him to board right till the doors were closing, checked his bag and all waited standby until I reached to bring his passport. Naveen Sikka, absolutely lovely man who helped my husband board as well as his colleagues who rushed him on to the plane, all incredible thank you all for your help! We won’t forget it! If it was any other airline they wouldn’t have even entertained it! Thanks again!",Indigo,2024,9
Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Sydney,2024-09-01,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   On the way in from Sydney to Delhi , there were no sound and the return flight was even bad. We had three family members travelling together sitting in the same row and none of the entertainment stem were working. Insult to injury was that the flight attendants did not care about it and no effort was made to comfort the passengers. Somehow they expected us to accept it. Seats are broken. Think many times before booking with Air India as it is full of surprises. Better to find any alternate flight because these 14 hours of the flight were the worst of my flying experience.",Indigo,2024,9
Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kochi to Vancouver,2023-12-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," This is the worst airlines anyone can choose, I had a flight with my family on December 1st 2023 from Delhi to Vancouver. The flight was supposed to be at 5:15 am, which was delayed later to 7:15 am, to 10:15am and 12:30 pm, then again delayed to around 1 pm. Me and my family were in a transit from Cochin. The airline kept on changing the time without any notice. My initial layover was five hours at airport which eventually led a twelve hour stay in an airport. Once I reached my destination and contacted the customer care, they wouldn’t help me out with the whole thing, instead they said they will contact me back vey soon. Till this day they haven’t. This is not the first time I’m facing the same issue. From my experience never choose Air India, the service is just getting worse and worse. No sense of customer satisfaction or helping them. To say the airport staff are just communalists. Even though they know a person don’t know Hindi they just keep forcing and shoving Hindi on to your face. I have called the customer service more than five times still these company does not give a damn about there passengers. Flying on Air India is just useless and you won’t be able to reach your destination on time. If anyone need to reach a destination on time go for a different flight. Also if the cabin crew ask me every time do I need veg / non- veg. If I say veg they serve me non veg and if I ask non veg they serve me veg. Overall this flight is ridiculous.",Indigo,2023,12
Family Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Cochin via Delhi,2024-08-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   Air India is the worst Airline I have travelled in the last 20 years.  I travelled from Cochin to Toronto via Delhi on August 27th. On August 28th after reaching Toronto, I realized 1 of my checked in baggage is missing. I filed the report at the airport, have been emailing all the India / Toronto contacts found, called customer care. The way these guy reply or respond give a single meaning they don't care. I have been getting no unsatisfactory replies or response from the moment I am trying to contact them and today has been 2weeks since reporting to them. The level of service they provide is beyond the worst. I am consistently emailing the customer care teams and relevant staff at Air India if you guys cant take care of the luggage's please make sure you revise the baggage policy. ",Indigo,2024,8
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Tokyo via Delhi,2024-09-01,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   18 hour delay in reaching my destination! Extremely poor management of flight delay in London, Despite 6 hour delay in leaving London and anticipated missed connexon, Air India insisted that we board the flight to Delhi (to avoid transferring to another airline) then transit passengers had to fight for themselves to obtain a transfer many hours later, Also, no entertainment during flight to Delhi, broken seat, just to name a few additional issues. I have requested compensation from Air India as I am entitled, no news so far, but I will fight to get what I am entitled for 520 GBP.",Indigo,2024,9
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Bangkok via Delhi,2024-08-01,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,2.0,"  Annoying, frustrating and sad experience I won't repeat. No idea how this airline can be part of Star Alliance with their standard being so far behind. Almost all entertainment screens were broken - dirty floor and seats with stains - no water or toilet paper in the toilets - horrible food especially for people who can't handle spicy or lentils well - seats in A320 ridiculously close to each other, got constantly slammed by the guy in front of me. This felt even worse than Ryanair but they're at least cheap, also there was no entertainment on 4hr flight - security at Delhi Airport steals your vape and lighter even if you just transit but let's you pass with a custom half liter bottle with an unknown substance? I have no understanding for this behaviour at all, Security also was unfriendly and arrogant. Absurdly high fees for change of flight data if ticket not eligible for online change (360€ for 1 day later), might be like this with other carriers as well but I don't like it. Actually the only good thing I can say is that you can take 2 big suitcases while Air France, KLM, Lufthansa ... try to rip you off here and offer long distance flight fares even without any luggage which messes up the results of flight search engines. I will avoid both Indian airports and Air India in the future, that was by far the lowest standard I have ever experienced by an airline flying to Europe. ",Indigo,2024,8
Business,Business Class,Delhi to San Francisco ,2024-09-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   We booked lie flat seats with the new Air India airplanes (AI 183 from DEL to SFO) but they changed to an old airplane with an ancient angled flat seat which should not even be premium economy. They also refused to change to a different flight or upgrade the class of travel, claiming very high change fees - even though I had paid $4,214 per person. This is in-spite of me having knee surgery last year making travel hard for me. Would definitely avoid at all cost - new management has not made them change their ways",Indigo,2024,9
Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Mumbai,2024-08-01,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,2.0,"   Just horrible. There are no hopes for this airline to get better. The equipment is super old, food quality is close to inedible and on-time performance doesn’t exist.",Indigo,2024,8
Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,2024-08-01,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,2.0,"  Travelled from LHR to Delhi in August 2024. Flight tickets were costly, even higher than BA or Virgin's ticket price. Two adults and two children were flying. what we got: An old aircraft with no inflight entertainment system, no charging points, seats wont recline and handles broken. only good thing was that there was a decent leg room space. Staff behaviour was as one would expect in the economy class. when i complained, I was told that a new A350 is being procured. but how does that help me in a really expensive flight on that day where the 9 hour flight seemed to take forever to reach delhi. In this age, asking about WIFI availability felt as if I came from the Moon. The quantity of food has been reduced so much now that I have started carrying my own.",Indigo,2024,8
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Calgary to Delhi via Vancouver,2024-08-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," Worst flight. Food was garbage. Totally frustrated, no value for money, deeply regret flying wit them. The reason was because my Air Canada flight to Montreal canceled otherwise I should fly in Qatar Airways. I'm blaming Air Canada first. Never ever go to my destination via Delhi from Canada. I have a dying feeling at the Delhi Airport customer care is -1",Indigo,2024,8
Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Leh to Kolkata ,2024-08-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   Worst airline available in India, never book with them. They charge handsome amount for select seats and change that in the last minute. No grievance redressal system available. The AI assistant is of no work.",Indigo,2024,8
Business,Economy Class,Narita to Dubai via Delhi,2024-08-01,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  I was flying from Tokyo Narita  to Dubai via Delhi. The checkin lady made a mistake in entering my information that they were not able to let me board even though I could have missed my flight, my bags were re checked that maybe the Red mark was because of that but nothing from my end. The manager had to come and manually fix the error in the system. The plane landed 1 hour 20 minutes earlier than the scheduled time in Delhi but there was no ground staff so all of us were stuck in the plane for 1 hour 20 minutes without an AC. The tv was not working, remote was broken and so were the buttons. The flight was for 8.5 hours and I cannot sleep on the plane. So it was a horrible experience",Indigo,2024,8
Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Vienna via Delhi,2024-07-01,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,1.0,"   Our bags were delayed by 2+ weeks, leaving us with no belongings for the entire length of our break. Over 10 hours were spent daily on the phone, with €600+ spent on replacement clothes/items. Air India offered only US$100 compensation citing a policy they do not share publicly, despite legal obligations to cover ""reasonable"" costs.",Indigo,2024,7
Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sydney via Delhi,2024-07-01,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   Pathetic service. Had taken Air India to fly from Australia to Europe return. Pathetic is actually like giving 5 stars. No words to describe. Entertainment unit not working on all 4 flights taken. Reason technical glitch. Poorest customer service. Staff seems least bothered of any request. Can't provide food requested except apologies. No concern for consumers travelling even when there request assistance button not working not just for our seat but for most of economy but staff seems least concerned. Staff making faces which makes you feel you did a terrible mistake by making a request. Poor air conditioning and sweating while take off , response is once we start flying and reach the altitude AC will be switched on. Never again. I wish it is closed or shut down so that people don't feel cheated at 33000ft.",Indigo,2024,7
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Melbourne/Gold Coast,2024-07-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   Will never fly with Air India again. Itinerary was New Delhi to Gold Coast, stopping in Melbourne for a transfer. I confirmed multiple times that I did not have to pass through customs in Melbourne to reach the Gold Coast and they assured me this was the case. I would only need to collect my luggage on the GC. What went wrong: - they charge premium prices and not even have working entertainment on board that works. I was on a 12hour flight without a working screen (like most people) - super uncomfortable seats - 2 delays - lost my luggage Conclusion: make yourself a favour and not fly with these guys. So unreliable. They charge premium prices and the service is equal or far lower than budget airlines.",Indigo,2024,7
Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Delhi,2024-07-01,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,2.0,"  If Air India has such lousy in-flight entertainment, usually the entire system doesn't work or, when it does it, offers little in terms of options, then they at least need to have phone/tablet charging outlets on long-haul flights so people can keep their devices charged in order to watch content they downloaded beforehand. It's a no-brainer. Get your act together, Air India.",Indigo,2024,7
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Seoul via Delhi,2024-05-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," I requested to cancel my ticket and had to deal with very irresponsible and bad customer service and lost my money.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Melbourne via Delhi,2024-07-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   The worst flight I have ever been on. I had a 13 hour journey from Delhi to Melbourne. My entertainment screen and my reading light didn’t work, meaning I had to endure 13 hours without any distraction other than the seat in front of me. Around half of the travellers appeared to have the same issue, which resulted in an unpleasant atmosphere on the plane itself. To make matters worse, I submitted an email to Air India ahead of flying regarding a severe allergy I have. At no point did I receive a response and I was later served food with my allergen in. Thankfully I realised and didn’t eat it, but it was crystal clear from the beginning that Air India do not care about the customer experience - despite the fact that I paid four figures for my flights.",Indigo,2024,7
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Melbourne,2024-07-01,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,  They give you the torture treatment. The flight was delayed by over 3.5 hours. My entire seat was broken. The entertainment system was not working. I could not even use the PA button to seek help from the air hostess. The toilets were beyond disgusting. I could just about use it once. The interior of the plane is stained. There was no non-veg food and the food was worse than prison food. Airline staff at the airport and on the flight were helpless. My flight was over 11.5 hours.  The customer service is non-responsive and only copy-paste responses to meet their internal TAT. They will force you to use the return ticket and not even refund it. ,Indigo,2024,7
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Delhi,2024-07-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"   I had a 13 hrs long flight from Toronto Pearson airport to Delhi but, the flight was very unpleasant and uncomfortable. The screen did not work at all and it got stuck up and didn’t move back on its original position. I with other fellow passengers had to sit idle without any entertainment The staff did not help me despite me telling them about it time and again. A co-passenger ended up helping me to re-adjusting it. Moreover, the meal tray was extremely dirty with tea stains and what not. Despite asking for a wet towel to clean it they handed me a dry tissue paper. Once landed, having a connecting flight to Amritsar, I received my luggage at the end and ended up in a neck to neck situation where i almost missed my flight. Moreover, one of the ground staff ended up taking $50 from me to get my baggage clearance at the end. I ended up at the gate on the last boarding call. I was really disappointed from the entire experience and a bit tensed now as i had already booked a round trip flight. I hope i get some refund out of what i paid to book my seat from Air India.",Indigo,2024,7
Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Copenhagen via New Delhi,2024-07-01,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  SYD-DEL-CPH-DEL-SYD: on each of these 4 legs we had no light, no call button, no entertainment and no apology. Leaving Sydney, we waited on the ground for 2 hours as people in hi-viz kept walking on and off the plane wearing worried expressions. The announcement from the flight deck was garbled but we understood the words 'technical issues'. By the time we arrived in New Delhi it was so late there was no slot for landing so we ended up in the cargo area and had to take a bus to the terminal. When we got on the plane in Delhi to return to Sydney we waited 10 minutes after scheduled take-off to receive the first piece of information from the flight deck: 'technical issues ... safety' and we were deplaned. 90 minutes in Delhi airport until a new plane could be organised. Then full security check again. We were compensated with warm water or juice box. But better to be deplaned on the ground than in the air. And, once again, no light, no call button, no entertainment and no apology. Generally the staff were good on the four legs - though conspicuously absent during the shambles of deplaning. Food too was OK, but difficult to muck up a veg curry. Needless to say, we will never fly Air India again. ",Indigo,2024,7

Hopeless airline, staff are beyond useless and unhelpful. Really incompetent and just pushing responsibility to solve issues on each other without helping any customers.

I missed my international flight to Toronto due to delay of Air India. After asking to provide me with a flight the Air India staff rudely told me it's not the airlines fault. Who's fault is this then that I missed my International flight that I paid around 3K CAD for? Not only that I had to book a new flight again that costed me around 3K CAD and because it was last minute booking the airline couldn't offer me vegetarian meal. After emailing and complaining about all this, all I get is a one line apology from Air India. Not acceptable. The Air India staff at Delhi Airport office are extremely rude, disrespectful and unprofessional.  Very unhappy with the service.",Indigo,2024,6

The Business Class seats were unable to recline, causing significant discomfort during the flight.  The entertainment systems in our seats were non-functional, depriving us of any in-flight entertainment. These problems caused immense frustration and disappointment.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Bangalore,2024-06-01,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,0,2.0,"  The boarding experience was tiring and cumbersome. Terminal 3 of Delhi airport is huge and each unit is situated in various ends of the terminal. Not sure if it is the system they use or staff having difficulty to use their system, the process of check in baggage is very very slow. I was stuck with a very stern officer who took considerable time checking each and every boarding pass more than the usual time and when I had to go to the cashier she refused to accept and sent me to another end of the terminal for payment. Running about with hand luggage was not fun. The cabin crew were polite and the inflight experience was fine.",Indigo,2024,6

Added an extra checked baggage at the airport and Air India already had told us the fees for $100 cad for the extra bag. However, when I arrived at Delhi Airport, the airport staff told me that the fees is Rs. 22000 meaning $380 cad. I called the airline and they just apologized. I ended up paying more than stated due to lack of information provided by the airline. I have had the worst experience with Air India. When landed initially, they misplaced my checked baggage which I received after 20 days of my arrival in India and then at the time of departure, they lied to us relating to the baggage fees. This is not done. This airline should have honesty and good customer service if they want to survive. Totally messed up airline, never going to travel with them again.

Air India crew members are lack of knowledge to process boarding passes for seafarers. Another horrible thing that the manager was confused about required documents, not cooperative at all and was demanding unnecessary documentation like DG shipping B1 visa (such a document does not exist). I was denied to get boarding pass and it took almost 1 hour to convince him that B1/B2 are USA tourists visas and seafarers joining ships required only C1/D visa. Please note as a seafarer I’m flying for almost 20 years and never had such a complication and harassment at check in counter. Kindly arrange training sessions for your crew.

Pathetic service to international passengers, never experienced this with any other airlines while traveling from London to Chennai. Travel duration from London to Chennai is 13 hours, because of this awful service extended to 19 hours, no compensation or not even lounge is provided to take rest, people with kids and elderly people struggling like anything.

Food served in business class do not have items mentioned in flight menu including basic snacks. Food served in business class with cutlery wrapped in plastic bags. Cloth napkin replaced by one single tissue paper. Quality & quantity of food served can not compared even with a road side dabha in India. Toilets lack basic minimum sanitization.

Business class looks like Premium economy of other airlines. Foot rest was stuck. Separation between 2 adjacent seats was for namesake, never able to put it properly. Once boarded, we were served a vegetarian roll. Said they are having catering issues and only boxed items are available. No notification regarding same was given to us until boarded the flight. Later came food in boxes with Vistara label (a sandwich, Haldiram packet, chocolate, granola bar). Vistara label is indicative that the airline was aware of the issue earlier. Why passengers were not notified either by email/SMS. No beverages were served. Had to ask for a coffee. Also had to ask the hostess to have the cup removed after 45 min. Lacking basic standards of customer service. Towards the end of trip, head of crew came to apologize for the catering issue. Return trip on 5/12 was in Economy class. No blankets were provided at seat. Audio-Visual system never worked. Should say there was food. Agents at gate were literally looting travellers by weighing cabin and personal baggage and charging for items bought from Duty paid stop. They had the most arrogant answers for questions or complaints Anyone travelling is doing it as it may be an emergency trip and cannot find tickets else were.

They didn’t have food in business as they had issues with catering and they knew it before they left India. All the business class passengers were handed out a box lunch, which had Vistara label. The Vistara label on the box indicate that they had prior knowledge about the catering issue and contained a soggy veg sandwich a chocolate and cookie for a 15 hr non-stop flight. The crew’s attitude was even embarrassing and no one even bothered to take the coffee cup back and it was done after a request was made and it took them 90 minutes to take the cup.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to Chandigarh,2023-12-01,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," The Airline was on a downhill spiral since almost 16 years if not more. When the Tata's took over people had high hope for its recovery. However even after 28 months things are as bad if not worse. I avoid flying this airline and rarely do unless I have no better options. It's a big let down for a Tata company. I do not know if there is any other business in this group that is anywhere even close to as bad as Air India is now. I also feel one reason the airline cannot improve is due to the guy at the top Campbell Wilson. This guy has a lot of management experience but most is for a budget airline and he is trying to run it in that manner. Just a recent example is the reduction of baggage allowance for domestic flights to 16 kgs for Economy passengers. This guy says this is in line with the industry trend. Well I don't think so unless he is comparing with the budget airlines. Even Japan Airlines offers 2x 23 kgs on its domestic flights. So what is the difference between AI and the other budget airlines, offering the same 15 kgs. In my recent case they advanced the timing of my flight which did not suit me as it did not give me enough time to connect with my Inbound flight from Tokyo. I called and pleaded that the new timing will not suit me and therefore I wish to cancel. I was told that I can cancel but there will be no refund. I have never had issues with their Star Alliance partner airlines when they change flight timings and I get a full refund in case of cancellation. Not only Star Alliance but numerous airlines with One World and Sky Team offer a full refund if new flight timings do not suit. Obviously this is another similarity with Budget Airlines. I definitely cannot recommend this airline in it's current avatar unless there is a drastic change which I do not see happening any time soon, definitely not under a CEO who is trying to run it as a budget airline. I also understand that the airline is currently at a loss. However with poor management and bad decisions they are losing further loyalty.",Indigo,2023,12
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Hyderabad via Delhi,2024-05-01,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  My recent experience with Air India on a long-haul flight from Melbourne to Hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, the journey was marred by a series of disappointments and discomforts that left me deeply dissatisfied.  The food served was not only of poor quality, but it was also presented in a manner that suggested utter disregard for basic hygiene standards. Packages were not just messy inside but also had spills all over the exterior, making the already unappetizing meals even less appealing. To add insult to injury, the taste was abysmal, and the quality of desserts was subpar, failing to meet even the most basic expectations. Moving on to the condition of the aircraft itself, the state of the toilets was deplorable. Broken toilet doors and malfunctioning facilities resulted in a pervasive stench that permeated the seating area, creating an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere for passengers. It's unacceptable to subject paying customers to such unsanitary conditions. Furthermore, the lack of inflight entertainment for a significant portion of the seats is simply inexcusable in this day and age. With technology readily available, there's no reason why passengers should be deprived of this basic amenity, especially during a lengthy 20-hour flight. Speaking of discomfort, the seating arrangements were far from satisfactory. Uncomfortable seats made the already arduous journey even more taxing, leaving passengers feeling physically strained and restless. And if the in-flight experience wasn't bad enough, the ordeal continued upon arrival at Delhi airport. The mishandling of baggage collection, with staff carelessly pulling out bags from the belt and haphazardly placing them outside, created chaos and confusion among passengers trying to locate their belongings. In conclusion, my experience with Air India was nothing short of a disaster from start to finish. The combination of poor food quality, unsanitary conditions, lack of entertainment, uncomfortable seating, and chaotic baggage handling has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with them again. It's truly disappointing to see such a renowned airline fall so far below acceptable standards, and I urge prospective passengers to think twice before considering Air India for their travels.",Indigo,2024,5

Regardless, the economy seat backs are about 2 inches of hard plastic coated in musty fabric. Zero padding to be found. For fifteen hours. The extra 1” of legroom when compared to US carries doesn’t add much to the experience I’ve got to say.

Well, more than uncertain. When we boarded the plane, the cabin was heated to around 35°, which remained the case for the first 1.5 hours or so of the flight.  The seatbelt indicator lights did not work either. This perceived safety problem was compounded by the overall condition of the aircraft. While the entertainment system at my wife's seat didn't work on the outward flight, it practically failed throughout the entire plane on the return flight. And that on a long-haul flight. In addition, one toilet didn't work, my seat back was in a catastrophic state and one toilet was out of order. In another, the washbasin was provisionally glued down so that it didn't fall off the wall. Do you feel comfortable and safe? A clear no. It's also cheeky: when checking in online 48 hours before departure, the seats are displayed. Our two seats offered at no extra cost were in different rows. If we wanted to sit together or enjoy a bit more legroom, we had to pay extra. Coincidentally, relatives of ours were flying from Frankfurt to Singapore the same week.

Supposed to take off at 2:15pm on 13th Jan from Delhi. Firstly I reach the check in Counter at 11:45 am and stood in the queue. There are so many counters for air India but any counter is not for a particular air India flight which males is so difficult for passengers as almost every passenger is asking the staff is this line for Sydney or Dubai or London or xyz destination. Secondly there were so long queue that by the time I reached the actual counter 1hr and 15 mins have already passed by. So finally at 1pm I reached the counter and handed my passport to the staff so they can check in and initiate a baggage drop. While the staff was checking my flight details I just got an sms that my flight has been delayed by 2 hrs and will now take off at 4:30 pm instead of 2:15 pm . Then the staff had a look and told me since your flight is now delayed to 4:30pm we cannot check you in you are too early for the flight, go and rest and come back in 1 hr and we should be able to check you in. So which means I had already waster 1hr and 15 mins in the queue then the flight is delayed by 2 hrs; after that I have to wait for another 1hr then stand in line again and then check in my luggage. What a waste of time. 1hr later at roughly around 2:15 pm I went to the counter again to check and she said your check in was already open about 2 hrs ago and that the person you spoke to earlier had given wrong information. Finally I did a baggage drop and went further for a security check. After security we went and waited for boarding as now the boarding was only going to happen at 4pm I still had another 1 hr with nothing to do. I had thought I will be in flight already 2:15 they would give food but now the flight is late by 2 hrs so no food for another 2 hrs and they did not compensate us with any complimentary food at the airport either. Slowly some time passed by and at 3:45 there was another announcement that the flight is now further delayed to a 5:30 take off. This meant that there has been a 3 hr delay from the original scheduled time of take off. Then at 4:45 finally they started the boarding so finally I had some relief and thought ok no more delays now . Almost everyone was seated in the flight and at 5:15 i heard another announcement that they are waiting for 1 passe ger as they have not yet boarded the flight. 10 minutes the passenger finally came. The flight finally started a take off at 5:45 pm. After all this once the flight was in the air around 6:15 pm they made an announcement that the seat belt sign is off and they provide snacks in some time. Finally at 6:45 they provided snacks and drinks.  Also from the time I sat in the plan the TV was not working at all. I informed them and they said they are serving food so they will do a reset after they finish with the food. They started serving food at 6:45 pm and finished by 7:45 pm . I told then again about the TV and they said they will go and reset now and it would then take 20 minutes to reset and come back up. So I thought probably by 8:15 at least I should be able to watch something . Once the reset was completed and I turned on the TV but still it was not fixed.

Our luggage was lost with no support or communication from the airline. The lack of empathy and remorse in the way customers were treated is unacceptable. Seeking assistance from a supervisor resulted in extra-long wait times, only to be met with dismissive attitudes. Holding a grudge for asking for help is not the kind of service one expects. I had essential medication in my suitcase, and despite carrying only a 2-day supply in my hand luggage, the lost baggage left me in a dire situation. It's now day 3, and there's still no news on the baggage. Additionally, there's been no communication regarding a claim or compensation for the inconvenience caused. The airline changed/cancelled my flight without any prior notification, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience.  When faced with a modified flight, I had no flexibility and was forced to choose their option.

From the outset, the ground staff at Mumbai Airport showed an exceptional level of support. The efficiency and warmth exhibited during the check-in process by the executive at the counter set a positive tone for the journey. I was pleased to find myself in a new and well-maintained plane. The seating was comfortable, and the cleanliness of the cabin was impressive. The culinary offerings were delicious. The diverse meal options and attention to taste were much appreciated. One of the highlights of my journey was the exemplary service provided by the guest relations team, which included Chhaya, Yash, and ABBU.

When an airline thinks it's OK to put a plane into service for a 14-hour long haul fight where the seats are falling apart, many tray tables were, loose on hinges and can't stay up when opened and barely latched when closes; and emergency floatation devices were detached from under the seat and on the ground.

Old worn aircraft, non functional entertainment screens, rude ground staff, seat recline not working, no time management. There was not even one leg of journey where the flight was not delayed by 3 hours. Last leg from Hyd- Del- LHR was the nail in coffin. For Hyd to Del leg, passengers were asked to board after 2 hours delay and then asked to sit in Aircraft further for 1.30 hours. The ground staff and flight supervisor told repeatedly to connecting 27 passengers (to London Heathrow) that connecting flight from Delhi AI 165 is waiting to accommodate them. To our shock, the flight had departed 50 mins before we landed. The whole ground staff is rude. Eventually after so much fight for a place to reach final destination, we boarded AI 161 after 13 hours of actual departure (of AI 165) from New Delhi and have just arrived in LHR.

No attendants were seen anywhere. I went to the back galley, no one was there. I called the attendant by pressing the button, still nobody came. My reason was that my entertainment console was not working. On top of this, the lady seated on the aisle (in was window seat) was now taking up the aisle and middle seat and her head was almost on my lap.

They tell you they will try to restart the console, but this is just an excuse as one of the attendants told me that 70% of the don’t work and they don’t try to fix them. Then, my transit flight’s time was changed from a 15 hour layover to 21 hours without any explanation. Delhi airport is not great for long transit.

But for my backup on my phone, it would have been an excruciating 15 hours to Delhi which the passenger next to me endured. Of the three meals served, two were almost the same. The caterer or the menu designer have to be changed immediately so that the passengers are not fed almost identical ill-prepared meals in quick succession. The toilets deteriorate rapidly as the flight progresses ending up as unusable as the flight nears the destination. Can the crew please provide enough TP for the entire flight?

Family Leisure,Business Class,New Jersey to Hyderabad via Delhi,2023-11-01,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,2.0,"  My experience with Air India was challenging due to the itinerary and service encountered during the journey. The flights had extended layovers – a 4-5 hour stopover in Delhi on the way to Hyderabad and an 11-hour stopover in Mumbai on the return journey to New Jersey. This lengthy wait was quite arduous and left a lasting impression. Regarding the in-flight service, it was satisfactory, although the food served from Mumbai to EWR lacked authenticity and didn't meet expectations. At Delhi airport, I was pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and modern infrastructure. However, there was a noticeable struggle to maintain cleanliness due to some individuals littering, which affected the overall ambiance. On the other hand, Mumbai airport was extremely crowded, and I faced challenges with uncooperative staff. Despite my long-haul flight, 11-hour stopover, and having a sick child with me, both immigration officers and Air India staff were unhelpful and showed reluctance. Their lack of empathy was evident, with one supervisor even making a disparaging comment suggesting I 'try my luck' with immigration. This was a disappointing and rude response. I strongly urge Air India's customer-facing staff to undergo training in empathy and kindness. As a business class passenger, enduring an 11-hour layover with unhelpful staff was a significant inconvenience and a negative experience. I rate my experience a 2 out of 10 specifically due to the unhelpful and rude behavior encountered with Air India staff at Mumbai airport. Such attitudes are unacceptable when dealing with customers who expect better service standards.",Indigo,2023,11
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Cochin,2023-05-01,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  My Mother passed away May 21, 2023. I booked an Air India flight to travel May 21, 2023 from SFO to COK to attend her funeral. My family scheduled her funeral accordingly so I could attend the funeral. I was supposed to land in Kerala May 23rd at 0700 a.m. in plenty of time to attend her funeral the same day at 3pm. My mother’s house is just 30 minutes from the airport, and I would have plenty of time to reach home a few hours before the funeral. But unfortunately, I couldn’t attend the funeral because the Air India flight was delayed at SFO for several hours causing me to miss the layover flight to go to Kerala. I explained my emergency to everyone who were responsible, but the Air India staff didn’t care about it and rescheduled a flight that wouldn’t reach Kerala until 7pm causing me to miss my mother’s funeral. It is important in my culture and religious belief to be present for the funeral and events following. How can I ever reconcile this situation in my life in my heart? The traumatic experience I had with flying Air India and missing of my mother’s funeral is still difficult to come to terms with. It took me a long time to even write my experience in this portal. Unfortunately, this wasn’t an isolated example of poor service on this flight. On return to SFO the luggage was delayed 2.5 hours! We were given the reason for the delay as “there was no baggage workers to take the bags off the plain.” Not only was my time wasted but my transportation home was waiting for almost three hours. This is completely unacceptable. I have been a frequent international flyer for years, on many different airlines, and I was expecting a much better experience with Air India since TATA took over. Disappointedly, my experience was much worse than ever before. I was shocked to realize that Air India doesn’t have a suitable plan to deal with emergency situations like this. Air India will not be an airline of consideration for future travels because I don’t trust their reliability getting me to my destination for important life events. I feel like Air India doubled my traumatic experience, my mother passing compounded by not attending the funeral. This is a regret that I must live with for the rest of my life.",Indigo,2023,5

Out of the Asian elders did not even know what baba ghanouj was. An elder couple behind me asked them to help me with their order as they were wanted veg only. I was happy to help. For the main course, it was an option between paneer or millet steak (vegetarian). As the air hostess was coming around to take our order, she tried to convince me and my family to order the millet steak saying it’s very good. I told her I would not like that, and I wanted the paneer. After two mins she came to inform us they all are out of panner and the rest of us will get millet steak. I was seating in seat number 9; I couldn’t imagine why we paid so much more for business class; when we didn’t even have a choice what we want as a main meal. The millet steak was so disgusting. Everyone behind me and towards the back of business class was upset.

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to San Francisco ,2023-09-01,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,2.0," My family and I have consistently had disappointing experiences when traveling with Air India. This time, it was my parents' first trip from New Delhi to San Francisco, leaving much to be desired. I had explicitly booked extra legroom seats for my parents, as it was a gruelling 16-hour flight, and I paid for these seats when I booked the tickets. However, upon boarding the plane, my parents were assigned seats in the middle section, as the extra legroom seats they had paid for had been given to other passengers who made a last-minute payment for those seats at the airport. This was not an isolated incident. A similar situation occurred in 2022 when my husband and brother traveled from New Delhi to San Francisco. To their surprise, their extra legroom seats were also sold to other passengers during check-in. It's evident that this is not a mere mistake but a recurring issue. It's deeply concerning that Air India's ground staff and crew members seem complicit in this practice. It appears they are profiting from this by allowing passengers to book extra legroom seats online, only to resell the same seats for additional rupees to other passengers during check-in. My parents were left with no other options, and the crew members displayed extreme rudeness by suggesting that my parents deboard and resolve the issue at the check-in counter. This is a clear indication that there's a systemic problem within Air India, and this practice is tarnishing the airline's reputation. To make matters worse, I applied for a refund, but Air India never refunded the money my parents paid for these extra legroom seats. This entire experience has left us deeply disappointed and frustrated, and it raises serious questions about the integrity and customer service standards of Air India. Such practices are unethical and damaging to the airline's reputation.

To begin with, the aircraft on both journeys appeared to be in a state of disrepair. The seats were worn out, uncomfortable, and lacked proper cushioning. The tray tables were broken in several instances, making it difficult to utilize them for any purpose. The in-flight entertainment system, or lack thereof, was another major issue. On both flights, the screens were either malfunctioning or next to non-existent. My family was left with no entertainment options during the entire duration of the journey, which was particularly disheartening considering the long hours spent onboard. Moreover, the meal service on these flights was subpar. The food quality was far from satisfactory, with unappetizing taste and limited options. As a vegetarian, I found the lack of suitable choices even more disappointing.

Some did not even get tickets to the 8.30 flight The flight was full. As a result of our 8 hour delay. We missed our connecting flight to Kathmandu. At Delhi, again no arrangements were made for us. We had to do it ourselves and had to ensure our baggages were also rightfully transferred to the new arranged flight more thank 6 hours later -  stranded another 6 hours in Delhi. We fought for some rest and sleep for lounge access. None was given, after much argument. Only a veg lunch voucher was given, estimated 450rp per person (there were 3 of us). In all of this no one apologised. The duty personnel in Changi Airport on the 9th past midnight to early morning 8.30am at the gate were hopeless and offered no sympathy or help. No one from Air India were at the transfer desk at 6am that morning to arrange for the new boarding passes. It was all left to Changi Airport staff to assist (and they were also clueless what was happening.  We were lied that we were to be placed on the 2.40am SQ flight to Delhi. In India upon landing, the Air India staff were clueless too. They even can tell us the midnight flight to Delhi did take off as per their system.  Following this I wrote at least 4 emails to vent my anger. All I received was a cancellation letter of my flight. I had hope and requested for a better treatment of our return flight back to Singapore on the 24th of September from Kathmandu. I received an email 8 hours b4 the flight mentioning my request for some comfort and upgrades will be looked at. At the airport in Kathmandu on 24th I showed to duty manager and supervisor he literally said our requests will be done in Delhi.  In Delhi nothing was done.

I visited India after 1.5 years and was talking sweets with me to Berlin from the duty free products for which there was a rule ""it wasn't included!"". But suddenly Air India have to weigh after security is done just to earn money! Staff members at the gate were so excited to earn 4500 Rs per kg for 5kgs overweight in the hand luggage that was increased when I brought Duty Free.

They promised to refund the taxi back to the airport but this didn't happen as well. In the airport, they lost our new ticket and it took an hour to get it back. We spent hours to argue with the workers of the airline and it were not honest. They promised lot of things but they were tricking us with all kind of excuses that were not real (they said there isn't more ticket in an other flight, and indeed there were, they said the manager left home and indeed he was there, and so on). Bottom line - we had a lot of expenses due to Air India improper service. We paid one night hotel, the taxi to the airport, food and living expenses and of course we lost two days of work at home.

The Flight AI687/07Aug BOM DEL departure was revised at 1800hrs without giving any reason to passengers. Due to the delayed departure of AI687/07Aug BOM DEL, they were rescheduled to fly on the next day after 24 hrs. Had AI staff tried and communicated with staff in Delhi, there was a possibility to be able to catch onward flight for Tokyo. But no such attempt was even tried by the staff. There were other direct flights from DEL-Tyo (ANA or JAL) on same day which could have been the next option. But no sincere attempts were made. As a result, my in-laws lost one complete day. They were then sent to hotel Sukh at Juhu. To travel to hotel it took 3 hrs taxi ride and while coming back it was 2 hrs. My in-laws started their Journey from Nashik at 6 am in morning and could only reach the hotel at 9 pm. It could have been so easily a hotel near airport. On second day (8-Aug), they were picked up at around 11:00 am and made to catch 3:30 pm flight without lunch being offered. The hotel even didn’t have basic facilities like soap availability. As a common traveler, I can easily understand that 4:00 pm flight being very important for travelers who connect to other international flights from Delhi. There should be alternative arrangements to make people catch the connecting flights. If it was known that 4:00 pm flight is going to be delayed and there is no other flight available until 6:00 pm, why efforts were not made to accommodate few passengers who have connections in earlier 3:30 pm We had to cancel all arrangements made for their pick up and re-book the car with driver from Tokyo.

Business,Economy Class,Dubai to Kochi,2023-07-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,3.0,"  Disappointing Experience. I recently traveled on Air India from Cochin to Dubai on July 12th, and returned from Dubai to Cochin on July 17th. I am writing to express my disappointment with the overall experience and share my feedback regarding the flight. When I booked my tickets, I had high expectations, considering that Tata Group had taken over Air India. However, I was disheartened to discover that the flight experience was no different from a low-budget airline, especially when compared to the services provided by airlines like Emirates or Qatar Airways. It was quite disconcerting to find that Air India, which is still considered a low-cost carrier, had higher prices compared to other budget airlines. Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention an incident that occurred during my return journey. During check-in, I had checked in baggage weighing 26.5 kg and carried a hand luggage of 7 kg. At no point during the check-in process did the counter staff inform me that there was an opportunity to accommodate an additional 4 kg of weight, which would have allowed me to make purchases from the duty-free area. Instead, I was informed just before boarding that there would be a weight check, and any excess weight would be subject to an additional charge of 50 dirhams per kilogram. This approach to charging passengers for excess weight without prior information or the chance to adjust the baggage is disheartening, especially considering the concept of making money seems to overshadow the overall passenger experience. To comply with the sudden weight restriction, I had to rush back to the duty-free area and drop the items I had purchased. I was warned by your staff that I might face deportation if I delayed the process. As a Gold member of Qatar Airways, I am familiar with the rules and consequences of deportations, so I complied without any arguments and quickly resolved the issue. This incident has left a significant impact on my perception of Indian airlines. I now question the level of service and commitment to passenger comfort offered by airlines, whether it is Air India under Tata ownership or any other Indian carrier. The flight experience itself was underwhelming, with seats resembling those found on ordinary buses, causing discomfort and subsequent back pain. Considering the recent acquisition by Tata Group, I had hoped for a significant improvement in Air India's services, but unfortunately, it seems that Air India remains unchanged. It is disheartening to witness a lack of luxury or any additional features that are commonly associated with globally recognized and exclusive airlines. This experience has left me deeply disappointed, and I feel compelled to share my concerns with you. I hope that my feedback can serve as a catalyst for necessary improvements in your services and customer experience. As a frequent traveler, I believe it is essential for airlines to prioritize passenger comfort, communication, and transparency to build a positive reputation. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I sincerely hope that Air India will take necessary steps to enhance its services in the future. ",Indigo,2023,7

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Newark via Delhi,2023-06-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug. After avoiding Air India like a plague for years, I decided to travel with Air India. Well the first time from SFO-CCU and back wasn’t bad. However, as the years have progressed, Air India has gotten progressively worse. Yes, Air India seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of Tata. Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats). However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever! However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in.",Indigo,2023,6

My new name for Air India is Air Never Again. The seats, service, cleanliness and ticketing were all terrible. We flew nine carriers on our month-long trip. None of them were close to being as bad as Air India. The discount air carriers Scoop and Batik put Air India to shame. The direct competitors Singapore, United and Cathay were so far superior that you'd have to drug me and tie to a seat to ever get me to set foot on Air India again. The plane was filthy. The seats torture devices left over from the Middle Ages. My in-seat entertainment system was broken but functional. I pointed it out so that it might be serviced on the ground and got a, ""no, one cares shrug"". The service was non-existent. The flight attendants made two appearances and then were nowhere to be found after meal and drink service. They just disappeared while leaving water in the open galley.

Two hours later when I asked them again, all they had to say was ""sorry, we tried but only technical person will be able to fix it"". The meal they served was not fresh. My brother had booked non-veg option for meal when booking tickets and he got vegetarian meal, that too, 1 hour late than others and had hair in it. When we asked the crew, she said their economy meal was over so they are serving whatever they could arrange. You guys are not even aware how many people are flying with you, forget the rest.

Most probably they did not have to fuel or their was an issue between pilot and ground staff as the pilot after being coerced after nearly 4 hours of no response from him announced that ground staff will speak.

We boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane- a closed space, with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings.

Honestly, at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get, alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time. We have lives and jobs to get to and there’s a reason we plan a trip.

On 19th May 2023, I took a flight from DEL to YYZ, with my wife, 80% of the monitors in economy, business as well as first class were not working (flight time 15 hrs). Some seats were not reclining!

We missed the flight 4am) from Delhi to Kochi because of our child was continuously vomiting and it was early morning 4am flight. But we reached airport little late (4:10am) they failed to arrange alternate flight for us and they told us to book new seats. They said you will get email after some time, as PNR is generated no issue. We trusted them and returned back to hotel. We didn't receive the email at all and we contacted the costumer service they also said its okay just go to airport and get the boarding pass. We went to airport little early (2am) with all our luggage, and child. When we arrived they said that in your name no seats book and all seats are full we cannot help you. We showed PNR number, they said but as you didn't get email we cant do anything. We went to manager of the Air India, she didn't show any interest in helping or solving the issue. We checked with other airlines. They had 2 seats, one seat like that so we had to book new tickets again with Vistara next day morning (3am) and we returned back to hotel again with all our bags (25kg bags, hand luggage) and child. Horrible service by Air India. Horrible staff members and irresponsible, non cooperative. They were all laughing making fun of each other and customers, no seriousness and no helping nature. It all happened in Delhi international airport. As we were confused and standing what to do, we were just observing them, they are so careless even for old people who are approaching them and they don't know the language Hindi or English.

On my way back to JFK from New Delhi on Thursday, May 18th at 2:20 AM, I asked an Air India check-in rep if he could upgrade me to business class. He said no because all the seats have already been taken. When I boarded and got off that flight, I saw that wasn't the case. I decided to submit a case on the Air India website and then was prompted to email [email protected]. I sent them an explanation on Friday, May 19th detailing all the inconvenience that was caused. Surprisingly, they replied to my email on the same day saying that they have ""shared details with the concerned airport"" and once they receive a response, they will get back to me.  I never received a response from them ever again. I requested a follow-up on May 29th, May 30th, and finally June 6th via email. I also called Air India on June 6th, but the rep kept asking me for my ticket number. I informed him that I've already flown and do not remember my ticket number. I asked him how I can find out this number. He didn't provide any assistance. Instead, he only repeated himself and decided to hang up. Very frustrating.

The plane was so old that the seats and infotainment systems were broken. People were literally trying to change seats to watch something in the screens. The most ridiculous part of all is that a manual in airlines said to not remove shoes. The people removed shoes and literally lied down on the seats, with blankets on, as if it were their beds at home. The crew did not care and was least concerned about correcting the mess. The washrooms were clogged and stinky. The attendant call was not heard for 45 minutes and till the time I stopped one myself to ask for water. I hated my overall flight experience. I don't know if these reviews are heard and seen by this airline to improve their service, but my experience travelling with them was the worst of all the airlines I have travelled with.

After coming down to Goa airport there was a layover for about 5 hours and after standing in a cue for 1.5 hours for check in again the staff said you have to wait for ""30 minutes more"".

The major disappointments are old planes with no inflight entertainment, and incompetent and rude ground services. I would give the credits to cabin crews who tried their best to be helpful though. Check in staffs need to be better informed on visa requirements, so not to annoy customers with proper requirements waiting. India's chaotic airport security is already a nightmare, but a ground staff in Delhi made it worse. In my experience, airport security staffs made a horrible mistake of not stamping my boarding pass. And an Air India staff at the boarding gate was very rude as if I was someone with a security risk. He made me wait to board the plane last without a proper explanation, to a point that a security lady was nice enough to give a calming gesture and signalling the boarding staff is rather a rude one.",Indigo,2023,5

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good.

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Bengaluru,2023-03-01,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  Appalling airline. My flight from Mumbai to Bengaluru (Air India 609) scheduled to depart on March 1 at 8:00 am was delayed initially for 2 hours for ‘technical reasons’. We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation. I learnt subsequently that my experience with Air India was not uncommon. I caution other potential passengers to read reviews and experiences of others before booking a flight on this airline. I will never ever book a flight on this airline again.",Indigo,2023,3

After takeover by TATA one expected it would improve but nonetheless seems nothing changed. Incessant delays, bad food, broken chairs. It doesn't deserve to be called an international airline. It's worse than domestic airline. The staff are completely disorganized and untrained. My flight was cancelled without reason. Then they allotted a flight the other day and that too was first delayed by 4 hrs and that wasn't enough they made us sit inside Aircraft for 3 hours due to a technical snag without any sort of aircon. After that the flight finally reached to its layover location after 7 hr delay and here again the flight hit a technical snag and delayed for 2 hr. Air India you should close your operations and stop tarnishing India's name. People of India are normally cost conscious and that's the only reason I guess they fly with AI when they get a better deal but I feel even if it costs higher just go for some other airline to avoid this.",Indigo,2023,3
Family Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to New York via Mumbai,2023-02-01,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,3.0," Complete disaster. The business class is definitely not worth it. But that's not the worst part! The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok. Fortunately, I had a very nice flight attendant who made my trip somewhat bearable.",Indigo,2023,2

Flying to JFK from Indore via Mumbai. Flight from Mumbai to JFK delayed 14 hours for now, maybe longer. Took me an hour at the airport to figure out where to go and finally the best they can do is put me up in a total dump of a hotel with no internet service, no cable, no television in the middle of a shanty, with no contact to the outside world other than paying $100 so I can access my US phone plan, no change of clothing. It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

Long haul flights are hard on older passengers and families, a friendly face and demeanor makes all the difference!

Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight.

She straight away rejected my request very rudely. Other passengers were observing the situation and offered me a help. The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help.

Business,Economy Class,Dehli to San Francisco,2022-11-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  Worst experience of my life. I paid more than $1500 to get to India from the US even though there were flights for $900. The reason is that Air India had a non-stop flight from the US. I tried to book online but had problems and had to call about changing my flight. Although I requested English speaking reps on the 800 number, all the people had only elementary understanding of English. And, for some reason, they would hang up the phone in mid-conversation. I even had a friend call and the same happened to her. I ended up talking another airline to India and flying back on Air India which was horrible and I do not recommend it. I also want to warn people. My card was charged almost $1517.49 Air India admitted the problem was on their end but I was only refunded $1253.66 For some reason they decided to keep $264.33 That is the first issue. The second was the actual flight.  I was shocked that they came around the cabin almost 2 hours into the flight with a dixie cup of water. I asked if they had a larger cup because I was very thirsty and the flight attendant either didn't understand English or she pretended she didn't understand English, because she shrugged and walked away. The food was horrible, the seats were horrible and had very little room, non of the screens worked and, even worse, none of the outlets that are in planes for recharging your device worked. When I ran out of battery on my iPad I tried to read but the light did not work in my entire row.

The highlight was the attitude of the cabin crew.  During the twelve hour flight, our cabin crew were absolutely delightful: They looked happy and we had a nice chat about the Indian wines being served on Air India during the bar service. They emanated a sense of warmth and caring. The professionalism and warmth of the cabin crew on this flight was probably the best we have ever experienced.

Every time they assured that the money will be refunded within next seven days but this excuse has been repeated for about seven times till date but to no avail.

I felt pain after the first hour, even after I placed the neck pillow provided, it didn't help. The food was good, the toilets were clean, the stewards were not stingy on the drinks and snacks.

The touch screen didn't work, the USB charging port and the headphone jack connector was broken. The steward was handing out landing cards to certain passengers and they should have just informed the people over the intercom to identify themselves if they needed one, I had to call out to them and then comes a volley of questions, are you a foreign national, etc.. why do they care?

Both ways we had the worst experiences regarding meals and baggage collection and transfer from aircraft to airport in Bangalore. Despite being in Business class, there was no decent meal available for people, who wanted to eat light and non spicy food. Seeing this, we booked a blend and one jain meal on our return flight. Shockingly, the blend food was spicy and had garlic in it and jain meal was also too spicy. The crew expressed inability to provide us any alternative, even such as fruits. The baggage in Bangalore could be collected by us after 45 minutes, despite having 'priority' tag on it. On reaching Delhi Airport on 8th November, it was worst. The flight attendant announced belt number-1 for baggage collection at the time of de-boarding. We waited for 30 minutes and then started searching from belt to belt and finally found our baggage for IA-507, was off loaded on belt number-5. Again after waiting for a long time, we were able to finally collect baggage. Both sides, the experience was terrible. Also that a lady seated on a seat ahead of us behaved in a very rowdy manner throughout the flight. Despite my telling the flight attendant, she did nothing about it.

The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.  After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.  After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.  The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.  The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality. It’s a disgrace for me to travel with Air India on a premium category international flight.  The hot tea/coffee was served in paper cups of roadside quality which can be bought in market for Rs 25- 100 pieces. ",Indigo,2022,6

The plastics were cracked, upholstery stained, cushions rock solid, paint peeling. The entertainment screen was not working and when asked the air hostess replied that it’s complaint in almost half of the flight. This happened on our way to and back. This is the first time we are travelling in Air India. In air India even on a £800 ticket (there were 6 of us including a 2yr old, so £4800 in total) you feel poor and wants to get out of it as soon as possible. There were not even a colour pencil to entertain a 2yr old, I shouldn’t be complaining about that, should be glad we even got a seat (not comfortable though) to sit for 8hrs. The food was heavily salted and tasted cheap.  The flights were not on time (affected the transit time, so we had to run from one flight to next) but I not as bad as I heard before, at least Tata taking over has done some good. London via Delhi is not a good idea. When you come from London you need to check out and check in your luggage at Delhi again, so that takes min 2hrs in transit time (not to mention the porters and staff at Delhi trying to scam you) and you will almost miss your next flight of the first one was late to arrive in Delhi.

The plane from Mumbai to Newark was dilapidated and some of the seats were even broken (they were still assigned to customers). The in-flight entertainment did not work. The flight attendants seemed apathetic to pressing the request assistance button on the seats. The food was just OK. We had terrible experience checking in at the Mumbai airport. The airport manager was rude and would not let me check in my car seat for free which is the law in the US and demanded me to pay extra money for it. He would not listen to my argument that I got it to India for free and this was my return trip back to the US. Only later I showed him that the Air India website listed that car seats travel free that he allowed me to check the car seats for free.

Their domestic aircrafts are in much better shape. There was a 8 hour delay to begin with. Paid additional price for booking XL seats for extra leg space but to my horror realized that these seats are narrower at the waist in comparison to a normal seat. Broken tray tables with cracks and stains, no inflight entertainment (for the entire duration of the journey) and a nonworking toilet added to our woes.

There is no difference in treatment of economy passengers and business class passengers. Its waste of money. Also one my luggage they had lost and it was international departure.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Paris via Delhi,2022-06-01,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,2.0,"  Thinking of an Air India flight with long stopover in Delhi? It was a horror show. Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there) If you book a hotel and organise a transit e-visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. (I had to argue to retrieve my bag tag, which was a good thing as I suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised). The delay meant I'd missed the last train, then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass. Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque since I was already checked in. No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray. No other airlines have this policy, and mine was summarily confiscated in Delhi ""you can't take things that fly on the aeroplane"" — seriously; that was their rationale! Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom was the only redeeming feature. Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian war zone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping embargos. French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between.

Nothing was done, so I just told him that I would watch a movie and let him use my screen after my movie. Midway through the flight, I was really cold, and it took me 20 minutes to call the attention of the flight attendants. The call button was not working, so I tried flashing my light from my cell phone, but nobody was minding me. Eventually, the person in the aisle seat in the same row took the initiative to inform the cabin crew to give me a blanket. Unfortunately, all blankets had already run out. The good news is that the person next to me shared his blanket with me. Also, after being served peanuts, the captain made an announcement that all passengers had to put their masks back on; however, the cabin crew was not implementing this. I have had a terrible sore throat for over a week now. I just wish Air India would take the health and comfort of the customers more seriously.

Once we were able to board our flight after many difficulties this airline caused, we were disgusted. The mould lining the windows and the seats was unhygienic enough but the movies screen were cracked and unusable .. only very few worked and when they did they were extremely difficult to operate. We received 1 water over a 12 hour flight and the food they provided us with was mid. Flew with both my parents and a friend of mine and we requested seats together, well at least for my friend and I because we're nervous on planes.

Business,Business Class,London to Delhi,2022-06-01,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,0,1.0,"  Onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work, this also applies in Business Class. One might think its a fault so they'll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not. I have found this issue continuously. My negative review with Air India really relates to my lost luggage. There are no words to explain the misery i went through with Air India in trying to retrieve my bag. At Heathrow I was given a P.I.R (Property Regularity Report and a ""authority to claim delayed baggage"" form which i filled in. Alongside this I was told my bag would be back within 3-5 days and was given a online tracking link. In this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents, this is just one example. I wrote several emails to Air India and although i had responses none of them answered my question. All responses were exactly the same (standard) giving me different links. Furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered. After 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a Air India flight back to Heathrow. The bag never arrived. I only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days - basically my mornings were wasted This happened four times. It is only when i built up a decent relationship at Heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally. I called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered. When the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it - a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to Heathrow. I got to Heathrow (to get in to the baggage area is another story) and opened up my bag to find many things missing.  Thankfully some of the missing items were located (thanks to the gentleman at Heathrow who understood my situation) at Delhi airport. They advised they wouldn't post it and someone had to collect it. With the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items, however without the connections i would have had to travel to Delhi and no doubt would have been harassed. In my opinion Air India has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down. I have seen more negative reviews for Air India than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and don't ignore them but rather take them on board.",Indigo,2022,6

Their staff members are rude and unprofessional. After flight booking I found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket, so I called customer support but its hours long wait time, then I tried US number which was picked up by a rude person who couldn't communicate in English or Hindi either, there was no resolution over the call. Before take-off safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws, cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand. Landing was very hard on touchdown. After landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt, hence we checked with Air India ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyone's luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport. The airline was managed by Indian government earlier, as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work, rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default, hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease.

I was told I can apply for a refund but when I tried, they always say we'll get back to you and no one ever does. I've been writing to them consistently for over 3 months.

First thing first was at baggage register counter was full with a lot of peoples because at the same G counter there was not just Paris flight register counter it was with Paris, New York , Toronto flight baggage counter . So there was a lot of rush it took us 2 hours to register our bags. And when we reach at counter the lady took almost 30 minutes to print our boarding passes . Then it took us 1 hours to complete the immigration process. We asked Air India employee to help us to speed up the immigration but he said we can't do anything then when we finished the security check. And ran towards our gate air India employee call us to come fast to boarding gate. We said we are coming but they did not wait for us for 5 min and can't let us in. We missed our flight. After that when i ask air India employee to help us but they were not helping us a lot.  I asked them to at least give me tickets for next flight because it was not my fault. But they said its completely your fault and we can't do anything for you. My wife was ill. she beg to your employees to at least help us in something but there was nothing from them. I asked to give us tickets for next flight but they said sir you have to pay 500€ extra for that tickets. Not a refund Not a coupon to eat something between the waiting time to get our bags. Not a single penny refunded and they are asking for 500 € We paid 500€ because we need to start our jobs.

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Vadodara via Delhi,2022-04-01,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  Before you call AI Customer service - grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process. You need to call AI customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service. Not even basic greetings. The rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly. Couple of times I asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual. Once you have your basic itinerary ready, they will transfer you to billing department which can take only AMEX or Visa card. They do have few other options like net banking, Indian credit cards etc. When you are ready to pay AI, representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment - 90% of the time that doesn't work. With that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours, so you keep on trying to pay. Then I put my Credit card information and my India address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened. My payment was accepted and here I am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company. Finally, after all this I had a ticket to travel. Before the flight I updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information. The website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again. BTW they don’t have separate line for TSA APPROVE either on the airport. It is one common line at Newark Airport (EWR). Finally, we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal. The air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a child's meal so unfortunately, we don't have an extra child's meal. I am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so I convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal. I had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck. The flight was Boeing 777 (OLD) plane which has no Wi-Fi. Everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working. The whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system. After that only 10% of the screens started working. Now on a 14 hour long flight you don't have Wi-Fi or screen. The people who already downloaded from home are very smart. In short, have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight. Finally, we made it to India and felt now everything will be fine, but my misery continued while coming back from Vadodara to Newark. As we reached Vadodara airport, all looks good, easy going, all documents verified and here I am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge. The rep is saying - Mam, all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours, so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass. Did he say had written boarding pass, I was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security won't let me pass. The AI rep is no mam, it happens sometimes, and they know. You please go ahead. As I reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass, the officer was looking at me as though I am an alien and had I issued a handwritten pass to myself. AI supposed to inform Airport security about this so I can have easy transition but knowing AI they didn't bother to inform the security. When I said firmly that it's between AI and Airport security finally AI security showed up and resolved the issue. ",Indigo,2022,4

We reported this to the service counter for Air India in the  Delhi airport before 5pm. Approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at Delhi Airport. However, they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5. I explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldn't return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning. I even asked if I could pay to have it shipped to me in the states. She said she couldn't help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed. Then once I returned to the states there was no one working the Air India counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call. I called the Air India number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that I had to call the Delhi Service desk (the same one that wouldn’t help me when I was standing there, and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me). I told him I couldn’t afford to call Delhi and that I needed his help and he kept saying no, call the airport and then he hung up on me. We called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing. The plane was terrible, seats had no cushions and no room. None of the TVs worked and there was no WIFI ... made for a long 17hr flight. The flight crew were rude and wouldn't let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the Himalayas and I wanted to see them. When boarding Delhi to the States you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board (full xray scan and everything).

We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines. Travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited.",Indigo,2022,4

AC too may not have been working because the air was humid and stuffy. None of the cabin crew came around offering water or other services.

I had booked seats with more leg space but despite me paying extra for this I did not get the chosen seats. This was frustrating. Nor will I get repaid for the extra fare I paid as now I dont have time to run after them. The heating system was overworking and the aircraft was boiling. When I asked staff to lower the temperature they were giving weird explanations that we are flying over north pole and temperature outside is minus 60. Finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch. The thermostat was not working. The saving grace was that most of the staff was hospitable and felt embarrassed by the poor quality aircraft themselves.

It’s one of the most mediocre Business classes I ever travelled in. It is more like glorified Premium Economy. Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping. Inflight Entertainment: The inflight entertainment is laughable. If you are not Indian, you will have like 10 movies to chose from. TV shows have only one episode. No music to listen to. Food: Its typical Indian food be prepared for that. Service: They server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice. You will be asked for drinks twice only. Cost: it was slightly cheaper than other business class when I say slightly 1200AUD less than other flights. And I chose it, which is clearly a mistake. Will not recommend this carrier.",Indigo,2022,3
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Chicago,2022-03-01,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  I have often heard of horror stories of international travel in Air India but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route. However due to a personal emergency, I had to fly Air India recently since it was the only way I could get to Chicago in time. Air India has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey. The tortuous check-in process with agents taking upto 15-20 minutes to check-in a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in Delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board. The aircraft was run-down and shabby, which was the second warning but the best part was when I reached my seat, I had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that I could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist. Of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 4-5 seats had a working IFE system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the Air India logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway, The seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests, I have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that I never have to sit in this seat again. This was not the end of it of course, the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 2.45 am, it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in check-in and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 5-6 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible. After this the crew decided to rest for 6-7 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own tea/coffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said tea/coffee in. Perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the IFE could not. Finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard. The only redeeming factor on the flight was that Air India is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight, it did not alleviate the misery in any way. The first thing I did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way I can put myself through such an experience again.",Indigo,2022,3

The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. The staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states “you have 2 options, you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.”  When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger, completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. I explained my situation to the united manager, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager out of her office. She stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional ie. broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C.  Anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were broken during take off and landing. Finally the plane was filthy, the entertainment non existent and the food terrible. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery.",Indigo,2022,2

Check-In Almost trouble free - the staff at Toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and RT-PCR test results. Staff must be trained to insert the Frequent Flyer number from other star alliance airlines. Boarding delay and nothing but chaos! There was no separate queue for business class.

We were travelling from Mumbai to Goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 KM to Terminal 2. The flight was at 9 PM and we reached at the desk at 8.15 PM. The Air India Personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in. It was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal. Later I have checked with many passengers who informed me that the Airline Portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal. Finally, all the personnel to whoever I spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport, and made sure that I should not board in the flight. Another harassment started when I went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of Air India. The booking officer on other side of the glass/window was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made. I kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to Goa. He somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls. I asked him what is happening ? to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets. After five minutes I lost my patience and left the window. Secondly, their call centres are closed after 18:00 Hrs. A recorded message will be heard continuously after 18:00 HRs that you are in queue, but no one will respond from the other side nor the IVR facility will be available.

I was travelling on 12th Nov 2021 from Ahmedabad to Chicago via Delhi. My flight was at 7:35 PM and I was inside airport at 5:30 PM. The Airport ground crew of Air India, stopped me and said we can not travel to USA as my infant child is holding Canadian passport and so she can't travel USA without valid B1/B2 VISA. They didn't even know that Canadian passport holders gets on arrival visa to enter USA. When I showed both of them the proof of USA & Canadian federal website and rules about the same that Canadian passport holders are allowed to travel USA and get on arrival visa. That supervisor told me ""people can write anything in their website, so we don't consider federal website as a proof"" I was shocked knowing they were not aware about the rule. When my travel agent directly contact to higher authorities from Air India and explained that they are wrong, I was issued board passes after 2 hours of harassment by Air India. The aircraft was so dirty and unhygienic to even fly. This was very old aircraft and there was food stuck in side the TV remote and all inside the seat corners.

My next seat customer has got the Non-Veg after some heated discussion, still no luck for me.  Seat recliner push-button broken hence can not push back. Flight attendant response - Cant do anything, we will check and sort this in London.

On the plane, when I raised the issue, the cabin crew and counter staff failed to rectify the situation. They then moved me to a demonstrably worse seat, one without a TV, which all other passengers had. Mind you, this was for a 15-hour flight. I understand that people sometimes need to have their seats shifted, but surely there were others on the plane who hadn't paid for their seats, so their seats should be changed, not those of us who paid for our seating.

Check-in and boarding were smooth. They served good food on time, however, did not serve any drinks (coffee/tea/ alcohol). It was at the back of the airlines for self-service. Cabin crews were good to help. The most disastrous incident was not working og inflight entertainment. I just can not imagine that time how to pass nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment. I would download some movies/ songs if I knew earlier. Air India does not provide inflight internet. In most of the seats, inflight entertainment system was not working. Touch screens are hardly working. On the second leg (Delhi to Kolkata), it was of approx 2hrs flight without any inflight entertainment/internet service.

I had very low expectations, and Air India was as bad as I feared. The Indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible. Every aspect of this trip was subpar, and given a choice, I cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline. Here are all the ways in which they were bad: 1) Their web site is terrible, and it wouldn't accept my Lufthansa frequent flyer number, even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers. The web site also wouldn't allow me to request a special meal, and it gave absolutely no explanation for why. From some google research, I realized this might be due to covid precautions 2) I made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues. The amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of New Delhi railway station for their calls. I could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying. They supposedly entered my Lufthansa number for me, but as I could tell when I printed my boarding pass, it wasn't entered properly, and it didn't work. I had to claim my miles via Lufthansa after the flight On a separate call, the rep took my special meal request and entered it, but didn't seem to know, or didn't bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during Covid 3) My itinerary was IAD-DEL-MAA, on different B787s for each leg. I flew business class, and the product is really sub par. The seats are grimy, the upholstery was torn on one of the legs, the seat power didn't work properly. Worst of all for me, the moving maps didn't work on both IAD-DEL and DEL-IAD legs. Also, the flat bed isn't long enough for my 6'3"" height. The pillow they give is a joke. The cabin crew were nice enough, but I really didn't like the heavy/greasy Indian food I was forced to eat on some of the legs. The food on the MAA-DEL leg even gave me severe digestion problems. 4) Air India lounges were open in DEL or MAA, supposedly due to Covid, but other private lounges were operating, so it seems like Covid was just an excuse. 5) On a couple positive notes, all my flights were on time, which was a blessing, and the prices of the business class ticket was well below pre-pandemic business class levels.",Indigo,2021,3

Arriving at Heathrow flying out on the 2 Nov 2019 we found the seat reservations that were booked in April had not been processed and our seats were not available. We had to waste time at the Air India desk getting alternative seats and ensuring the rest of our bookings were in place. Onboard the outbound flight two of the toilets nearest us were out of use as were two out of the three entertainment systems in our block of seats (in fact one was completely missing). After some time and having been re-booted the other system was back in action. The on-board staff were courteous and helpful, seats comfortable (we paid for the emergency seats with lots of space in front) and the food was ok but only choice was eat it or starve. Basically the same can be said for the return flights adding that the flight from Udaipur was nearly two hours late without any explanation.

Scheduled flight departure time was 8.10 p.m. from Kochi but the flight was delayed initially by 40 minutes than by 1 hour 20 minutes and finally took off at 10 p.m. with a delay of 1 h 50 minutes, and due to which I missed my pre-booked train from Mumbai to Vadodara. I had a similar experience during my earlier flight which I took from Mumbai to Trivendram on 26/10/2019. The flight was unnecessarily got delayed just because crew members did not arrive on time. When I claimed for train fare, I received terrible reply ""The flight AI-055 of 03 Nov 2019 was delayed on account of the late arrival of the incoming aircraft from Mumbai and the delay was unexpected and unavoidable.

The flight from Kathmandu to Delhi was delayed by 2 hours, and when it came to finally boarding the aircraft there was another security check of bags before you walked up the steps to the plane, it felt really disorganised and unusual given we had already gone through security. It almost puts doubts in your mind as if they don't trust the airports security process. When we got on the plane, the air hostess was rude and demanded I put my bag in the overhead locker despite just taking my seat and organising what I needed out of my bag. The food was not nice, and the plane was quite dirty.

(1) There were no blankets supplied in most of the economy. When asked the flight attended simply said “We are sorry we ran out. When the ground crew said they only had used blankets from prior flight we refused for your safety”. (2) the in-flight entertainment system was broken and attendants simply said: “sir this is an old aircraft so many are broken - too bad”. Many “low class” customers travel in the Middle East / India sector and don’t know how to use the system and end up breaking it”. (3) food. I traveled by Air India many times and their saving grace was always good food. But this time I noticed it was super frugal (just an entree and small piece of bread ). To understand all this I struck up a conversation with one of the attendants and learned some stunning truths. He said “ sir everyone in Air India is aware of the poor quality of aircraft, non-working in-flight entertainment systems etc. but don’t seem to care. In fact, we file a detailed report after each flight, citing customer grievances, key issues etc, but nobody that can impact the situation cares. Net, it is a leadership problem. There are no customer service metrics attached to senior operational leaders’ performance evaluations and hence the outcome, As long as India government subsidies with plum jobs, customers like me can refrain from using Air India but that will not matter at all as economic forces are not at play here, For those wondering, the fare between United Airlines and Air India for this same route was almost equal (United was actually $100 cheaper and Air China was 50% lower), so Air India does not have the proverbial price advantage. I also learnt 2 new aircraft were acquired for traveling public but later converted to Air Force One for political leaders. The older aircraft if used for fare paying public. The business model is unsustainable. In new India, will someone take notice?",Indigo,2019,11

This was the first time I was flying Air India, and I have truly never used a worse mode of transportation ever. Air India has the worst aircraft with the most ancient entertainment systems. But that is a mere inconvenience in the harrowing experience that Air India considers to be an acceptable journey. After missing my connecting flight at Delhi International Airport, thanks to the inefficient airport security, and spending the night at the airport, when it was time to check-in to my new connecting flight, the Air India personnel at the counters were extremely curt, unhelpful and uncooperative about checking in my luggage that was already cleared from my previous flight. Upon boarding my next flight, I was welcomed to an unclean seat and food tray. Once I finally landed at my intended destination, Air India managed to lose one of my checked bags, which I was reconciled with after 6 days.

We chose them because they were offering the best times for both trips (but they changed them later from 8.40 in the morning to 2.40 in the middle of the night - and they do this apparently regularly). On both flights (actually all 4 flights because there is a stop over in Delhi) the online check-in was not working - as a result my family of four were spread all over the plane. In one case they booked as in row 23, but the aircraft only has 21 rows. So their IT is simply not working, everything is utmost slow (it took us 20 minutes to check in at the desk in Colombo). The aircraft from Colombo to Delhi is really old and dirty and this in combination with a non working IT, you don't believe that they really care about technical standards and safety. The entertainment system didn't work on both flights from FFM to Delhi. Every passenger needed numerous resets to get the minimum going - the minimum means a really small collection of outdated movies. I think even 15 years ago other airlines had better entertainment systems. This is clearly not acceptable. Sleeping was also difficult because we had numerious kids crying on all flights. The only positive aspect: some of the staff (not all) tried to do their best to solve the problems. So at least for us: never Air India again no matter how good their flight times are or how cheap they are. It is a shame that they are a member of the Star Alliance group.",Indigo,2019,8

The cabin only has 18 comfortable seats which make excellent beds at the press of a control. The layout is 2x2x22 so you could be unlucky if travelling alone as not much privacy.

The staff were rude to us and the the tray table was filthy and had bits of dried up food stuck on it, when I reported this to the stuff they handed me a tissue asked me to it clean up. You could have at least cleaned up the aircraft for the passengers to use and I take this offensive because hygiene is important to me. Next when we reached Delhi we were told to collect our luggage from the luggage belt and load it on to the next flight because it was a domestic one, this was the first ever time any airline had asked us to collect our luggage when we hadn't even reached our destination. At first we weren't sure because we had flown before and this had never happened so I asked the people at the information desk for help, there wasn't anyone else there but for some apparent reason the people at the desk couldn't see me I said excuse me about three times before someone looked up from their phone and when they did they were unhelpful and they looked at me like how could I disturb them from they're phone's.

Unfortunately, it ended up being Air India. I flew from Denver to Washington on United (Code Share) and then Washington to Delhi on Air India. The flight was delayed by a couple hours.

I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi. So, I had to file a delayed baggage claim. The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn't enough staff available to help. Nobody knew what information to provide. After struggling for a couple hours, they filed a delayed baggage report and they told me I'd be receiving my bag within a couple days. After a couple of days, I called them and they told me that they didn't know where the bag was. So, I started calling them everyday. It would take me a couple hours of calling before they would pick up the phone. The phone operators never had any information about what was going on. One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore!!! I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report. But they never responded! After 10 days, I received a call from a local airport. They told me to come pick up the bag. I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home. As I had a family emergency at home, there was no way I could travel a couple hours to the airport to pick up my bag. So , I told them that I would be filing a police report for stolen bag if they didn't deliver my bag. After several hours, they called me to let me know that they are sending the bag with someone to my home. On Air India's website, it is mentioned that there is $50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours. I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation, but no one responds. I have been sending them emails every day without any luck.

Due to the short length of the runway at Mumbai airport and incompatibility of Air India, they always remove passenger baggage without ever informing them. They use a very common excuse ""bad weather"". So don't be surprised if you realize at your destination that your baggage was removed and never arrived with you. All other airlines are perfectly fine to land and take off from the Mumbai airport and you never hear any excuses from them. After realizing that you and several other passengers reached their destination without your baggage, the real fun (or frustration) begins. You will realize that Air India has only one phone number for their customer service contact which is the real deal. Average wait time to talk to a representative is over 60 min based on online search (I'm not exaggerating, in my personal experience these were the timings: 96 min, 118 min, 72 min and 130 min). Well after these wait times, you'll end up talking to the most idiotic morons on this planet who probably hate the entire human race. They no idea about anything related to Air India and no respect to listen to what you want, let alone help you. The frustration continues as these reps have no connection to the baggage department and then ask us to get a mystical ""complain number"" before they can look into our case. After calling the customer care for the fourth time, I was told that the number for US baggage department (973-242-0078). Now, I called them over 10-15 times over a period of two days and no one picks up the phone. The fun part is their voicemail box is full and not surprisingly you cannot leave any message or ever get that mystical ""complaint number"". Wrote emails to all departments of Air India including the baggage department. Still waiting for a reply. It's been three days and I'm looking for the lost baggage for me and my parents who travelled to the US and sill have no response from Air India. Please save yourself all this trouble and choose any other decent airline over Air India (even if its a few hundred dollars more pricy).",Indigo,2019,6

I am thankful that it was United who issued my tickets and were reliable enough to help me. Air India CS was a nightmare to deal with. Couldnt help. They couldnt find my record, they couldnt assign me a seat, they couldnt confirm anything. Not to mention I was on hold for an hour before they answered the phone. It was United Airlines who put in an hour to communicate with them and help re route me when my flight got cancelled.",Indigo,2019,6

Don’t fly Air India unless this is your only resort. 1) I was traveling alone with my twin 3 year old daughters. They offered no support during the flight. I smiled more than they did. 2) I asked the hostess for water upon boarding and she told me to look in the seat pockets. No such thing was found. The seats were in horrible condition when we arrived. No one had cleaned after the previous flight. 3) No inflight entertainment. Everything was broken. 4) Calling the hostess is a useless exercise. Don’t bother waiting. 5) The arm rests were broken and cracked dangerously enough to cause a hazard for little kids. They kept falling on them when they were trying to sleep. 6) They have nothing to offer little kids. No coloring sheets, stickers. Nope. 7) Had booked child meals and was never offered the option while serving. When I complained, they simply said “You should’ve asked for it.” 8) When I whined about all this, one of the hostesses said that she’ll come and take a look. She never came.",Indigo,2019,6

Air India flight was supposed to take of at 11 pm IST on 15/06/19 but let us cook in the flight for some 3 hours while mending a technical fault in the aircraft. Then at 2 am the air craft becomes grounded & we are requested to deplane to board another aircraft. Further we are subjected to a security check a second time which also became a harassment as there was hardly any staff to speed up the unnecessary process. The small children had become very fussy by 3 am. Then we boarded the next flight running to the next opposite gate so that flight could now leave in a orderly fashion. But after 15 minutes an announcement was made that the pilots had to deplane because of some regulations. With no further explanations about the current situation, there’s an announcement plz open gate l2. At 5 am with much confusion people started deplaning the aircraft a second time only to surround the two ground staff for some kind of explanation. It was really shameful to explain to the foreigners who didn’t understand hindi that its okay for the National Carrier Of India to behave in such fashion. But my biggest challenge of the night was dealing with my own 3 year old who was so excited, didn’t sleep until 4am in the morning & was constantly asking ‘when’s the plane gonna fly, when do we get on our cruise?",Indigo,2019,6

I was traveling with my son and to make it easier instead of 2 suitcases of 23kg each I chose to carry 1 suitcase of around 28kg. While going to Paris I travelled in Emirates with same luggage allowance and had smoothest check-in. But for my return flight they did not let me check in because I had one suitcase and asked me to either make it in two bags (which  I didn’t have on Paris airport) or pay for excess. Even on requesting and telling them I have 46kg combined allowance for both tickets on same PNR but they denied stating I have to pay if I am beyond 23kg or I need to find my solutions and come back to them for checking. The air hostesses in flight were least interested in service. The headphone of my seat and my neighbours weren’t working and even after multiple requests they never even for once got time in a 9 hour flight to change our headset and thus no entertainment for us. Our flight from Paris to Delhi gets delayed. After customs and immigration the luggage drop off counter is a small crowded counter. No proper queues and Officers are the most rude people you will encounter. They at the last moment before dropping our luggage asked us to check in the liquor bought on duty free. We had to take out clothes from our bag and put bottles inside on the counter which was badly crowded and unprofessionally managed. Upon arrival in Mumbai after almost 15-18 hours and waiting for almost 40 mins for our luggage we are told that our baggage is left in Delhi and will come in the evening flight and will be delivered only after 1:00Am. On telling them that this delivery time is not acceptable they day they can only deliver that time or next day but when we told them there wont be anyone at home as we will be at office.

I asked for explanations many times but the only answer I got is ""one second madam"". After about 10min, when finished with the ""out of nowhere"" customer, he handed me back my passport while telling me that my flight is tomorrow.

After getting my boarding card for tomorow's flight I went to Air India's agency to demand an accommodation or any other assistance while waiting for my flight the next day. The only answer I've got is that there is nothing I can get on the spot and all I can do is to send a complaint by email to ask for compensation. If possible, avoid Air India at all cost.

It was so hard to get up in those vehicles as the stairs were steep and my mom and dad who are old, struggled badly. Male security persons were opening ladies purses and searching them so disrespectfully. When I asked what's this checking for, I was not given any answers. The body check was also done in the most disrespectful way and everyone was feeling frustrated. When we finally came onboard, none of the staff or the captain apologised for the almost 2 hrs delay.

The chicken came with rice and vegetables with a separate side salad and desert, all of which was tasty and of good quality. On top of this there were two drink-runs and before landing they provided another sandwich. The seat was good (admittedly I forked out for an exit row which I then was happily able to have the whole row to myself), legroom good enough for a giraffe.

I'm a multi-million miler, and I'd be hard pressed to think of a worse experience than 15 hours on Air India. Not all of it is the airline's fault--but if you connect from a domestic flight to leave from Delhi, you go through seven different ID and security checks before getting on the plane: everything from accessing the terminal to accessing the gate, each has its own separate security inspection. I'm not sure what terrible people they believe would pose a threat to an airline which needs no help falling apart. At the gate. We were delayed several hours for reasons unknown and unexplained. When we did board, there was immense disappointment. The seat cushion at my seat was clearly from a regional aircraft and did not fit the seat, It covered maybe 75% of the seat area, and the rest of me was sitting on the gap or directly on the metal seat frame. The entertainment system was non-functional. A 15 hour flight, and it was broken. But whatever, it's 4AM and we've been waiting almost four hours to leave. It's time to push back. And we're back to the gate. At least the pilot checked to see if we had fuel before taking off. Because apparently we didn't have enough. And refueling took another 40 minutes. That hardly seems like a top up because we idled the engines for too long. And now we're finally on our way. The food served was...pretty dreadful. The cabin crew did their best, but the condition of the aircraft wasn't their fault. However, the cleanliness of the aircraft was indeed their responsibility. By midflight, all but one lavatory had run out of toilet paper and paper towels. The one lavatory which hadn't run out of paper had an actual hole punched in the bottom of the toilet, and was covered in human waste as it could no longer flush. It was probably the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen, and even worse, there were no alternatives--waiting another 6 hours wouldn't end well for me. The ironic thing is that the inflight maps show the locations of famous shipwrecks as you fly over them--which serves as a reminder that there are some journeys that actually are worse than flying Air India. Change here needs to start from the top, and run through this organization like an avalanche. They'll need years of good reviews and quality results before I'd consider them again, but I don't think they'll have that luxury.",Indigo,2019,2

At my seat the IFE was not working but it was not of any real consequence as I had planned on maximizing my sleep / rest time onboard. There were 3 hot meals provided on this sector with refreshments / dinner / breakfast provided. As there were some seats vacant I was able to slip back to those seats, stretch out and take good rest for 3-4 hours which was a huge advantage as I was feeling really fresh upon arrival which was 15 minutes ahead of schedule.

What a way to celebrate the international womens day than spend 5 hours with mom at the Delhi customs office, where we literally left close to midnight. This is after completing a 12 hour journey from Sydney on a flight with Air India. On the day that Air India was boasting about having an all women crew on all flights originating from India, My mother and I were struggling dealing with the rash, unprofessional and unethical officials at the AI office. This was my first and last experience with Air India My only reason to opt for this airline was because Air India is the only flight that was flying direct, allowing me and my pet to travel together. There were a lot things that went down that day, that showed lack to professionalism, ethics, corruption and misconduct. Firstly, my pet exporting company did not get a response from Air India till less than 24 hrs of travel , despite submitting all documentation more than a week ago . Secondly , I was waiting at the airport for least 40 mins as per the advice of the baggage team for my pets collection. After constantly nagging them for more Information, they told me to collect the cat from the cargo area without any directions provided to locate of the building. The Air India cargo group and customs office had absolutely no idea on how to deal with the import of a pet . There was a very obvious lack of training , and lack of knowledge of the process and protocol . All I saw was chaos and officials palming us off from one dept to another. Thirdly , air india mucked me around for another 2 hours before actually sending me to the right dept, all I heard throughout my discussion with them was whether I have an agent as they mostly deal with agents. I assume these are the middle men who get the job done. I told them there is no need for these as ACQS India has a well defined protocol that they should be following , to which that had absolutely no response apart from ""I should hire an agent. "" The middle men in India will follow the same process as what I did, the only difference would be some extra cash they slip in the pockets of these officials, who did not seem to want to do the job. I was also told that the server was down for maintenance that day, and the money has to be transferred online and only using the net bank of public banks such as PNB. The customs kept repeating that the Air India was not responding . However when my mom reached her threshold at 10. 30 pm and lashed out at the entire dept creating a a scene, the job was done within 15 mins. Air India was responding , the server was working and the money was collected in cash. We were given the gate pass to collect our cat and mom and I finally left the premises at 11 pm at night. This was my warm welcome back to my country. I can only imagine the loops they make foreign citizens go through.

The three boarding passes were granted to her and then she boarded an Air India flight from Paris to Delhi, everything when fine until she landed at Delhi and was ready to take her flight from there to Bangkok where the ground personnel realized that my wife did not have a Thailand visa and after having the boarding passes in Paris by the Air India personnel access to board that flight was denied. The Thai Airways ground agent when the extra mile and try to help my wife in any possible matter but her hands where tied and nothing more couldn’t been done, therefore the Thai personnel refer my wife back to the Air India agents and that’s where our nightmare started. First of all the agent was very rude, my wife English is very limited and when I ask her to pass the phone to allow me to talk to him and see what our options were, after having a very un respectful conversation with the agent he toss the phone back to my wife and refuses to talk to me, another agent with a very kind attitude helped my wife, unfortunately the decision was made and my only option was to buy another business class ticket to my wife back to Paris.

Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Chennai via Delhi,2019-02-01,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  
San Francisco to Chennai via Delhi. This is the worst international airline I have taken ever.  The flight from SFO to Delhi departed 40 minutes past the scheduled time. When it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure time, the captain informed us of the delay due to some reasons. I wondered what stopped him from informing us of this earlier. They have the worst in-flight service. Most of the IFE screens are malfunctioned. Some didn't work at all. The selection of movies, shows etc. were so limited and mostly outdated. The screen resolution would remind of 90s experience. There is no organization shown by the in-flight crew. Some snippets from the plane - People would stand by their seat for an hour or so every few hours ; couple guys would stand in the pathway , chatting for 30-40 minutes. Not to mention that it created so much inconvenience for fellow passengers to go to restrooms ; group of 3-4 guys would stand by the kitchen and restrooms for couple hours and chat casually. Surprisingly, I saw couple crew members joining them as well ; Some people in their seat would never stop chatting , though it was late night. The entire thing felt like a typical Indian fish market. I had a connecting flight with Air India to Chennai. Since the SFO flight was running late, I inquired with the crew members about the connecting flight status. Some said it won't wait for us and some said it would. After we landed in Delhi an hour past the scheduled time, I ran towards the connecting flight gate. The flight was still there but I wasn't allowed to board it. I had 3 other folks who were going to Chennai. We were put in another flight that left 3.5 hours later. Of course, the drama didn't end yet. This flight was scheduled to leave at 7.55 pm IST. It was 8.15 pm and there was no announcement on the status. There were two AI staff members at the counters. After I inquired about the status , they made an announcement for the ongoing delay. We boarded the flight 45 minutes past the scheduled time. While we were getting off the plane at Chennai, one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry-on bag in the restricted overhead compartment. Most of us saw a crew member putting it there since we ran out of space. So unprofessional. My return flight from Delhi to SFO saw another hiccup. This time they delayed the flight because 7 passengers couldn't come on time due to a delay in arrival from Mumbai AI flight. Remember how I missed the domestic flight earlier and I was told that 300 passengers couldn't wait so they had to leave without us. But they could delay the international flight for a delayed domestic flight. Such theatrics could only be seen with them. This is the first in my experience. They let down us again with horrible food (no seasoning and bland). Refreshments were barely edible. I would say it was the worst food offered on an international plane. ",Indigo,2019,2

We left Goa almost 2 hours late after scheduled time. We were told that we wouldn't lose the connection because the plane that we were going to fly from Goa would stop in Mumbai, get new passengers and continue direct to Delhi. When we arrived to Mumbai we were surprised as they told us to go out, together with another passengers to the counter E and check in again. We already had checked in back in Goa. We were running all the way through the airport to the counter. They changed our tickets and surprise! We run back again to find out that we went back onto the same plane. We left Mumbai delayed, probably because of so many passengers running around the airport. Later, staff told us that the plane in Delhi to Copenhagen was going to wait for us because we were around 10-15 people going on the next flight. The plane to CPH was supposed to leave at 14 and we landed in Delhi at 13:35. When we came out from the plane there was an operator waiting for us to guide us fast through security checks etc. to the other plane which was waiting for us. We went all together and the surprise was that everyone boarded and we were refused. They told us that our names were deleted from the passengers list. The staff could not tell us what happened or why did it happen, claiming that it must had been in Mumbai where they thought that we won't make it on the CPH plane. We looked at the plane from departure gate, leaving the hub at 14:43. That is when the nightmare started. The staff at the gate told us that our bags haven't even arrived from Mumbai due to the fact that we were deleted on the list. We spend 8 hours at the airport trying to solve our problem. Air India staff were rude when we asked for what happened, lazy to answer our questions lacked of professionalism. From the staff from the gate (4 people), we were pushed to another group of staff, then another staff and so on. They didn't admit the mistake they have made moreover, they claimed that we were late for the plane and that's why we lost it. We were fighting with everyone trying to get the true and they were sugarcoating us all the time. We were not the only ones at the airport with similar situation to ours. They even didn't want to give us hotel to spend the night. After fighting a lot they gave us a really bad and disgusting Hotel. During all day we were with no food and no water. Additionally, our bags went missing so we had no clothes to change or any hygiene appliances with us.We had a very bad ending of our holidays because of Air India's staff incompetence.

This was my first time in AI business class, I was traveling at very short notice due to a family medical emergency and AI had the cheapest fare $3400 RT. My collection of experiences reaffirms why this airline which had its heyday in the 70s and 80s is now the laughing stock of the airline industry. The staff's attitude is unmotivated and their approach lacks professionalism - they kept trying to take away my food and drink when i clearly hadn't finished, and otherwise wouldn't clear items when i had finished for a while. The chief purser only stayed in the 1st class section and never came out once to introduce himself or spend any time in the biz class section. The tray table hinge was broken (both ways of the roundtrip) which meant it was pressing against my thigh and couldn't be moved front/back. And the seat controls are atrociously bad - its hard to figure out which way its actually moving and the grating jerky movements make for a poor customer experience. The meals served was mostly lukewarm or cold and the staff didn't seem to care. If this is the experience in business class, i really dread to think what the economy class must be like. Clearly the airline strategy is to compete on price, not quality of service. And the final straw is that i got an email today asking for feedback - when i provided it and try to submit i got a response (please note the spellings) ""Server Error Please Try Later Sorry for Inconvinence casued to you. Team Air-India"". This is an unbelievably poor airline that is being badly managed and run for years.

The remote control had no buttons, basically useless, the touch screen was barely working and the remote was dirty. The chair was rough and it snagged my stocking. For each leg of my trip I had to call crew assistance once, and none came until the food was served. Only spicy food was available. Barely any crew service on the 7-hour flight, but on the 3-hour flight they offered refreshments occasionally. I got allergic contact dermatitis on my hands from the soap in the bathroom and I've only had an incident once before, from paint, so there is something very strong in their soap... so I couldn't wash my hands in flight (bags were transferred by the airline so didn't have the chance to get my own soap for the 2nd leg of the flight). Luckily, they had medicine but of course I had to go to their area for help and endure my burning hands, the crew were talking to each other that I had to say ""excuse me"", it almost felt like I was bothering them. They looked at my hands (there were no visible sores, it was just a bit red but it hurt so much) and they took their time. The 2nd leg of the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours, no proper notification and in possibly the worst airport ever. I want to sound impartial but there are really no better words.

These supervisors engaged in a 3 hour argument with these 60 or so passengers and at the end offered nothing to the passengers at all. I was embarrassed for the employees of the airline and the passengers who were from India - the riotous display the airline was unable to control or relieve tells me they have no concept of current airline practices or any consideration for customer service.

I was pretty worried because of the mixed reviews for the airline but because of the cheap price we decided to book them anyway. The check-in and boarding was not the fastest but in the end the flight was on time. Inflight entertainment had nice current hollywood and bollywood options. The service and especially the food was very good. I had mutton with rice and my girlfriend took the vegetarian option. Both meals very very good. The Aircraft had some slight signs of usage but was clean. Overall we would take Air India again because we feeled save, had good food and the overall price-performance ratio was good.",Indigo,2018,8

Upon landing the Chief Purser came around and shook everyone’s hands, remembering names and thanking us for choosing to fly with Air India. The services were fine, with a choice of alcoholic beverages and pre-dinner snacks. The meal was not too bad, but unlike other airlines, the whole thing, including dessert is served on one crowded tray. The promised choice of desserts and chocolates never appeared. This is not a deal breaker, but just a bit surprising given the number of staff and the limited number of seats in business class. I think where Air India falls down is in its décor. Even though this was a fairly new Boeing 787, it looked tattered and worn. The colors, light tan and sad red, give it a dingy look. Entertainment choices were ok, and the seats were generally pretty comfortable. All in all, a pretty good flight with a few drawbacks.",Indigo,2018,9

My family and I had to wait for more than 3 hours because the numbers on our tickets didn’t match theirs, even though we were still on their list of boarding passengers. Our tickets were issued from Turkish Airlines since we had a connecting flight from Istanbul, Turkey to Mumbai and then to Ahmedabad. We have previously dealt with this same situation when we were going from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, but when we called Turkish Airlines and explained this situation in front of the Air India staff, we were immediately given our tickets. However, this time, we had to pay for our tickets again. Air India was simply cheating us by making a huge deal out of a small mistake that they themselves have made with our tickets. We had to pay double the amount for our tickets only to recieve the same treatment and service. I would rate Air India zero stars if I could. I will never board Air India ever in my life.",Indigo,2018,7

Unfriendliness of staff is  seen even before the flight has taken off. On top, they seem so rude. I am traveling with a 6yo and every other flight I have taken so far with my son (Delta, Air France, unites, Lufthansa, American Airlines) have been so friendly and helpful but it’s a different story here. Plus the flight seems so uncomfortable. It’s so hot, on asking they have been asking to wait since half an hour now. My son has asked for water 3 Times now but alas no one is listening us.

Air India offered the worst possible service on the return flight. It all started when airline agent didn't check the baggage through to the final destination and I had to pick up the entire lot (6 bags) plus 2 hand luggage, baby changing bag and the laptop bag also while handling a toddler. Add to that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours from Delhi to Birmingham and the onward flight from Birmingham to Belfast missed. Had to wait for several hours before some lady with half information and no patience booked a hotel for us to stay overnight and booked the next flight at 18.45 next day (even when there were 3 other flights from the same airline available at earlier times). Add to this, we were kicked out of the hotel by 12:00 forcing us to go to the airport 7 hours earlier and spend time with a toddler till the flight came. Flight was delayed by 25 min...(fortunately it didn't get cancelled) and we reached our destination 24 hours later than planned.

My wife and I booked a flight from Munich to Goa via Frankfurt and Delhi in Business Class, then after some days from Goa to Kathmandu via Mumbai and the return from Kathmandu to Munich. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt was operated by Lufthansa, the other flights were operated by Air India. The booking was in one ticket. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt with Lufthansa was nice. When it was time for boarding in Frankfurt, Air India could not open the ticket. After a lengthy discussion we were finally allowed to board the aircraft (without boarding passes), which already had some 45 minutes delay due to our issue. Our seats that we reserved months ago were given to other passengers so we had separate seats. The business class seat actually is okay and so was the onboard service. The seat just looked dirty and used. Air India uses a new 787 on this route but they look like old 767 that have been in service for the past 20 years. After all, we were just too frustrated to enjoy them. Once in Delhi, an agent picked us up and escorted us to the gate for our connecting flight which we boarded without a boarding pass. While the Air India representatives in Frankfurt organized that we arrive at our destination, they did not think about our Air India flight from Goa to Kathmandu. Long story short: The agents in Goa could not find the ticket and we booked a new flight to Mumbai in Economy Class. The agents in Mumbai could see the ticket but since we did not use the portion from Goa to Mumbai the ticket was now invalid…and we bought another Ticket from Mumbai to Kathmandu. (By now the ticket was refunded and we received a compensation. But that was a long way.) Verdict: I had quite a few other flights with Air India last year and there is always something that does not work. It is part of the adventure of travelling to India I guess, but in the future I will try to avoid Air India. It is just not a good airline.",Indigo,2017,10

After taking off from Washington, D.C. lunch was served around 12:30 P.M. After lunch the dinner was served around 9:30 P.M. almost after 9 hours. In these 9 hours there was no food service at all. They did not care to offer even a light snack or a sandwich. for nine hours and this was in the Business Class, we do not know what they did in the Economy Class. When asked the staff about this, we were told that they are suppose to serve only two meals in such a long flight. We can understand you serve two major meals but how about some snacks etc. in nine hours. It would have been fine but since I am a diabetic and need to eat some thing on regular intervals. But sorry that is the only food service they offer. Wanted to talk to the Supervisor about it and was told the supervisor would come to talk to you but of course nobody came to talk to us at all until we landed in New Delhi as if you simply do not care and if you are diabetic then it is your problem. We have flown in Business Class on so many different airlines around the world and have never experienced such a poor food service. Have you ever compared your business class service with other airlines? How can you compete with them with this kind of service? They serve food, drinks and snacks throughout the flight in Business Class without even asking. No wonder Air India is losing money. Who would like to pay this kind of money for Business Class and get this kind of service. It is surprising, at one time Air India was known for it's food service. We were totally dissatisfied.",Indigo,2018,4

I had a truly unforgettable experience with Air India - in its worst kind. In fact, two awful transit experiences in New Delhi from Kathmandu en route to Colombo and return. Both initial departure flights on separate days were delayed, conveniently resulting in my unexpected ""royal"" transit treatment in New Delhi! On my way to Colombo, the Delhi transit desk staff blankly told us that we had missed our connecting flight and simply would not board me on the next Sri Lankan Air with the excuse that this was a split ticket. Instead a staff member gave me a few numbers to call for the issuance of a new boarding pass. Eventually advising me it's best to purchase a new ticket as I was pressed for time. He even handed me a 'delay certificate' (w annotation at the bottom ""We thank you for flying Air India and wish you a happy journey) that could be used as proof in the event I would like to be reimbursed for the new ticket purchased! Ultimately, I was stuck at the Delhi transit desk for 5+ hours (along with other angry customers), even after paying out of my pocket for a new connecting ticket as I was made to endlessly for the issuance of a new boarding pass.

I flew back from Delhi on flight AI0111 at 14:00 on Thursday 10/5/2018. The flight attendant that was serving the right hand side of the economy row facing the plane was a mere piece of cattle that was being forced to work against her will, well at least that’s the impression that me and my family members got along with others on that section. My sister was given a seat with no onboard entertainment for a flight that lasted approximately 8 hours. She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row “be careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replace”. Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break. These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome. A demand for change of seats was declined too. The concept of customer service is a mere myth to this establishment. If you value your custom and value for money my strong recommendation is seek alternative airlines and stay away from this airline. I regret flying with Air India and will never do so in the future.

At least 8-10 entertainment systems are broken in the flight and the attendants don’t care or do anything other than saying sorry sir this seat entertainment is broken. Despite being an Indian airline the food they serve is so horrible - it’s just unbelievable. So many other international airlines serve 10x better food.

The stewardess working on the flight made an incredulous expression when I pointed this out. I ended up changing seats to another two seats. All of them appeared to have problems with the inflight entertainment systems. Some did not have the touchscreen working. Others did not have their remote working and others had to be repeatedly restarted before they were usable. The flight attendants did not seem too concerned about this problem. I had similar problems on the flight back. Many of the passengers on both flights appeared to have inflight entertainment systems which were non functional or dysfunctional and the Air India entertainment system in general appears to be by far the most user unfriendly system I have ever encountered of any airline. This represents a major inconvenience on lung haul flights which are up to 15 hours in length. The Boeing 777s of Air India do not seem to be well maintained at all.

Check in at Delhi was a bit frustrating because their software were having troubles. So had to wait a bit longer in line. But finally I was directed towards the gate. The plane was prepped in time. While boarding the plane, I was recording video, but a flight attendant by the door of the aircraft gave objection to it. His behaviour was rude. He took my hand and told to delete that video in front of him. I was a bit shocked at his rude behaviour. But I did as he asked. He told me that it is against their policy to record video which I was not aware of. Still, I apologised. Nevertheless, the plane was amazing. The economy window seat which I got had plenty of leg room and great seat incline and massage options. Most importantly, the infotainment system of the aircraft was amazing. I enjoyed that a lot. The plane took of on time. After 40 mins, meal was served. Food was rice, chicken, vegetables, salad, bun with butter along with ingredients to make tea/coffee by yourself. After a 2 hr flight, the plane landed smoothly Then the connecting flight from Kolkata to Dhaka was in an Airbus A319. That aircraft was delayed by 20 mins. The plane had a bit tight legroom.

Each passenger was served a fresh and excellent meal at no extra cost (unlike super over charged stale sandwiches from the other domestic airlines). I am a foodie so trust me the food was amazing. They even served coffee and tea to everyone at no extra charge (I pay 160 Rs to 200 Rs for one coffee with other domestic airlines). The ambience of airplanes reflects the Indian culture. You receive warmth, love and care like you would receive from any Indian home. I had a bad impression of Air India until today. The ticket rates are competitive and sometimes cheaper than others.

My seat was not reclining nor was my TV working and when I requested the crew he said - ""madam please I am busy"". When I complained to the other crew member he said he would help me and after that both the flight attendants started avoiding me. Travelling for 14 and a half hours without TV and it was not just me, there were so many other passengers having the same problem. They behaved as if they doing us a favor.

Earlier this month I reviewed the outbound sector of my trip, this review covers the inbound sector on the 31st January. Although the plane was a Boeing 787, it was quite an old one and hence badly maintained. The seat cushions had all of the comfort sat out of them, there were quite a few overhead lights which did not work and both mine and my companions headset sockets were faulty. This time, the crew were a little bit better but only very marginally so. We were given a reasonable lunch meal soon after take off, the cabin crew came round once during the nearly 10 hour flight with water and our pre early evening landing snack of a roll was so cold as to be almost frozen. During the flight our ""seat belt"" lights came on a few times due to turbulence but this did not disturb the crew who stayed inside their curtained off galley areas and never came out to check that everyone had buckled up. When we were landing, no one came around to check that seat backs were in the upright position (and therefore many were not) nor to check that people had buckled in. The cabin crew member who was a few feet away from me and in charge of an emergency exit, closed his eyes and went to sleep for about 20 minutes whilst we were landing. I suspect he was assuming that if we crashed on landing, the jolt would wake him up ! Does anyone in Air India care about the poor performance of their economy class cabin crew? I imagine not because otherwise these reviews would not be published.",Indigo,2018,1

I stated I had certain dietry requirements when I booked, also via email, the app and at check in. When I got my meals none of them suited my dietry requirements. I didnt eat for over 18 hours due to this. The staff were dreadful, when pressing the staff requirement button no-one came, you had to actually go to the back of the plane and interrupt their mothers meeting to which they were extreamly rude about. They also made facial expressions and hand gestures about people on the plane. When they came round with drinks and food there wasnt a single person who didn't recieve nasty looks or sarcastic comments. The screen on my first flight was broken therefore I had no entertainment for the first flight, and on the second flight my partners remote didn't work on his screen. Both times we let the staff know to which they didn't do much about or even seem to care. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. ",Indigo,2018,1

When we initially checked in for our flight in Chicago to our departure in Ahmedabad. The policies they state on their website do not correlate what the company actually adheres to i.e baggage policy. During the flight they have the worst customer service. I waited over 20 minutes for an air hostess after pressing the button and when I asked for water when they had a chance I was scowled at and not to mention they never even brought the water. Overall I would never recommend this airline to anyone flying. ,Indigo,2018,1

Air India receives very few positive reviews and very many negative reviews - unfortunately this review is one of the latter ones. Our plane was quite new, possibly less than half full so we had plenty of room to stretch out, change seats etc. We took off on time and landed only a few minutes late due to stacking over Delhi. Eventually the inflight entertainment system worked after a couple of reboots although I would have to say that the choice of films was one of the poorest I have encountered on modern planes. So what was wrong? What seems to be the usual I am afraid with Air India - the flight staff who did only the very barest minimum during the flight and hid away the rest of the time doing nothing other than talking to each other. We were served a non alcoholic drink shortly after take off immediately followed by breakfast. Some people later had their trays collected, others did not. Five hours later the crew appeared again, served a non alcoholic drink and dinner (mine was barely warm and had to be rejected). Trays were collected and that was all we ever saw of them. If you wanted any in-flight water you had to go and search it out because no one ever came around the cabin offering anything. There were no inflight announcements about journey duration, route, weather, delay on landing. Four airlines fly London Delhi direct (BA, Jet, Virgin and Air India). I have flown with them all and whilst the Air India plane was the most comfortable and its day time flight timings the most convenient, the service was the worst. I suspect that no one in the airline really cares about receiving poor reviews, wouldn't it be nice if some one did?",Indigo,2018,1

They lost my bags at the Mumbai Airport, which is another terribly run organization and should be avoided at all costs. My bags have now been missing over 72 hours. They open a case through their Airport baggage organization, which is contracted to help Air India with lost baggage claims. It also allows Air India to evade responsibility and accountability. If you try to contact Air India customer service to discuss compensation / details of your lost bag, they tell you they can't help. They direct you to Bangkok. Bangkok gives you the Air India policy and tells you it's completely non-negotiable. They say they don't have the power to do anything, any changes must be done by Air India, and they direct you to call Air India. This allows Air India to completely evade any negotiation or accountability. So far as a business class passenger with no bags for 72 hours+ I've been given a paltry 50 pounds, about 65 USD at the time of posting. Should be enough to buy a decent pair of pants. If this company wants to call itself a premier airline, they need to go back to elementary school for customer service. I've heard that the Mumbai airport which they base out of has a huge issue with lost baggage. Save yourself the nightmare of losing your bags overseas. Avoid this joke of an airline. ",Indigo,2018,1

Aircraft was not as clean, seats were dirty and some of the armrests quite loose. Cabin crew attitude and their behaviour with passengers  leaves much to be desired. On three occasions they served drinks or food coming from behind rather from front, no eye contact, no smile, nothing. In the first serving they gave options of non-veg/veg/continental food but in the second serving only option was Indian food which was too spicy to be eaten by a person living in Europe. I went to the galley area to have some water/juice and had a small conversation with the crew, while I was standing they remain seated on their seats without showing simple courtesy of leaving their seat, stand up and have conversation, galley area lights were too dim to see anything and on one occasion I found all lights switched off (total darkness). They did not bother to check toilets, if there are toilet seat covers, tissue papers are available or not. Simply said, I don’t care attitude runs in their blood.

Staff were really nice looked after the people in business class and offered drinks and food. After take off, food was served and the food was really tasty. Only thing that bothered me was that Air India doesn't serve alcohol in the domestic sector. Layover in Delhi was good and efficient, and soon we were ready for take off.

I always had a good opinion about Air India international flights in-spite of several inputs from family and friends not to fly Air India, however I experienced this during my recent travel. The crew were extremely impolite and not hospitable. They refused to serve non-veg when asked for. They asked me to weigh the baggage at a counter and at that point of time it was well within the baggage allowance, however at the point of check in the baggage showed an excess and I was charged a $100 dollars unnecessarily as penalty. To double check this I weighed the baggage as soon as I got home and found it was just 0.5 kg in excess. The entertainment unit is the only source of entertainment on a long flight however in spite of repeated requests to the crew of a dysfunctional monitor nobody bothered to rectify it.

The cabin crew delivered the worst service I have ever experienced. No smile on their face, when I stop one of them for a cup of tea, they look annoyed and not willing to do so. Waste and garbage on all desks as the crew didn't care to collect them when they saw them. I actually brought my own tray of finished food to the crew and saw them sitting chatting.

No WiFi service on board. In-flight entertainment was limited. I'm a gold level flier and this was my worst flight experience. I reclined my seat and it failed to return to a seated position about 5 hours into a flight. After messing with the seat for 15 minutes, the flight attendant put me in another seat - only to find out that that seat did not recline at all. 15 minutes later, a discussion with the purser, I was switched with another passenger and found his dirty socks in my seat.

Currently reeling under the situation of being sold off privately, the airline seems to be in splits as far as operations go. And my dissatisfaction started right from the check in kiosk itself, with the representative not from AI, but from a contract with the DIAL corp. The attitude this representative was showing unnecessarily was very upsetting. Boarded the flight with a half-hearted Namaskar from the flight attendant, something I was not expecting as AI FA's used to be the pride of the airline and a great first impression with their onboard greetings. This half hearted attitude stayed throughout the entire crew faculty present onboard the flight. No proper training given either; the methods used by the FA's to receive and give drinks was extremely clumsy as well as the attitude with which flight information was given. Food was also mediocre, not so special, but appreciated. No complaints from the flight timing, took off and landed before time! The aircraft however was extremely old, no personal IFE screen and the seats were not as comfy, not to mention dirty. While deboarding, the attitude of get-off-the-plane-already was present. Completely ruined even the last impression of the flight. Overall I do not encourage travellers to board AI, they don't seem to take customer reviews and feedback seriously to improve service. Price wise flight was great though and timing was efficient, being one of the first flights to leave the capital for KTM.

The cabins were grubby, I had to ask numerous times for a cloth to wipe my area and screen as there were finger marks of old food still on the screen. We felt that the crews on all the legs were all quite surly and really did not want to be there and anything was a bit too much of a bother. Once the meal service was done they all huddled in the galley and sat and read. On the transit at Delhi the ground staff were not much better at the customer service experience either, we were met with rude agents barking orders where to go as we had not heard an announcement due to having queued in security for an hour.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to London,2017-08-01,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1,10.0,"  I had travelled on the early morning flight from Mumbai to London on this Air India flight and was pleasantly happy with the experience on this flight. The flight departed on time and the load on this sector was quite a bit. After takeoff, the breakfast service commenced and as I had opted for the vegetarian option, a veg cutlet, stuffed parathas and bhurji was provided along with a croissant, fruits and tea. The breakfast was very tasty and sumptuous. The inflight entertainment was ample for this 9 hour journey and had sufficient programs to keep one occupied. I also managed to get a few hours of sleep aswell in economy class. The seats are comfortable enough and there is ample legroom. Quite possibly the best legroom for intercontinental flights in economy. The crew were very polite and carried out their tasks with utmost professionalism and provided regular drinks of water/juice to the passengers. Before landing the crew distributed immigration cards and also lunch was served. Once again opted for the veg course which consisted of mixed vegetables with rice and rajma followed by dessert and tea. The quality and quantity of food served aboard this flight was excellent and we arrived also perfectly on time which was excellent. The fact that steel cutlery was used instead of plastic forks/knives was quite impressive. Would definitely fly again with Air India and recommend this.",Indigo,2017,8

I have to admit Air India exceeded my expectations, both sectors was on time and flown on B787 dreamliner which was clean and legroom was better than QR and EK. Food was good and IFE was acceptable. The only downside I felt was the attitude of some of the flight attendants, there was no smile and looked as if they were not interested in the job.

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Madrid via Delhi,2017-07-01,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,0,2.0," I would not recommend Air India if you are travelling with kids. I have a large family and the cabin crew were unhelpful to say the least. The food (curry) is unsuitable for small children and they did not have a children's menu (apparently this is available but you need to request in advance, something which we were not told at the time of booking despite entering the ages of the children). Even if those are their rules, the cabin staff could have tried to help (eg with extra bread or a snack) rather than leave small children on a 10 hour flight with no food. The staff were clearly not accustomed to dealing with children and were constantly complaining when they dropped stuff (blankets, wrapping) on the floor (as kids do). One passenger had to tell them to stop scolding his 2 year old as that was his job not theirs (the kid was very well behaved). The flight from Delhi to Madrid was almost 10 hours and the staff basically served food, cleared up and then did nothing until about 90 minutes before landing when they served a very small snack. Anyone who needed anything had to go look for it themselves. On the flight to Delhi I left my Kindle ebook in the seat pocket. Given we were in the last row I fully expected the cabin staff to recover it when they checked the plane on landing. However, 4 weeks on I still don't know. The email for lost luggage doesnt work so I had to contact the airline and was given 2 alternatives. I have since sent a number of reminders but have had no response (the emails have been read).

Food was disgusting on the way back from India. Air hostesses were rude with attitude problems.

Since advertising the Boeing 787 as their flagship plane I was looking forward to flying the aircraft for the first time. However to my surprise it was probably one of the dirtiest aircraft I have been on. Airvents had so much dust accumulated that the vents had turned black. Broken trays.  In my experience the airline had good punctuality in this flight however I would be cautious if booking with them to check for delay patterns. Staff are somewhat helpful however not very welcoming or engaging. Felt they were really there just to dish out the food. Did not get a single response from any stewardess on the aircraft on all occasions of travel when using the assistance button in seat. Inflight entertaintment is probably one of the worst. If you are flying I would suggest downlading your favourite shows or movies beforehand. USB charger ports were not working in my friends seat, so he had to use mine, while my entertainment screen buttons were broken (physically broken). Overall I would not fly with Air India again unless I have no other option.

There is more room between seats and the width of the seat is wider. Food is okay, booze plentiful and wide choice. No Noise Reducing headphones, which is normal in Business Class. They do not have their own Airport lounge but at Heathrow share the Lufthansa lounge which is nice.

The flight crew on this flight were quite polite and professional. Even though the departure time was 1pm, we had left around 1.15 or so. After departure, lunch service had commenced and as this was a domestic flight, Air India serves only vegetarian options and so had a meal of paneer masala and rice with dal. For dessert a sweet dish of barfi was provided. The food was excellent. After lunch, tea was served.

Business Class toilet ran out of tissue and no one bothered to refill it. It was empty throughout the flight. Again this is simply outrageous. My entertainment system did not work at first. I reported this to one of the attendants and he restarted and it seemed to work. But in the end, the Flight Map was still broken. There were no meal menu given to us during this trip. The meals were verbally communicated to us. I paid $US2,000 only to be told what is in my meals. I had two small meals during this flight and each time I completed my meal the tray was not picked up in a timely fashion. I think I must have waited 25 minutes after I finished my meal, for the tray to be picked up. The flight attendants did not walk down the aisle as often as I think they should. Service was not a top priority for this set of crew. Meals were warm although I've had better economy international food than Air India's business class.

Upon waking up, a second round of food and drinks service started and watched a Hollywood movie. The non veg option contained chicken and rajma with rice, salad and gulab jamun.

I am already on my way to airport, i was informed that the flight got cancelled due to technical issues and should postpone my visit to next day.

Once reached the NY airport, was asked to find a connection flight on my own from DEL. I had to put up an hour's argument to prove my point that its a last minute cancellation and would be difficult for me to rebook a flight from Delhi and it being after 7PM will be even more difficult to find any local flights. Now, I am not sure if i can take the risk of flying back in Air India as the last minute cancellations seems to be pretty common for them and asked them to cancel the return trip and process the refund. its been 7 days since i made multiple calls and haven't heard from them yet.

Boarded the plane and we sat there with the In-Flight Entertainment not working for an hour and a half. We had to remind the flight attendant to turn it on. The screen though is massive, and there is a wide variety of movies in HD in English and Indian. This is probably because of their new 787 Dreamliner which is very nice. The seats recline a lot and the windows are all tinted blue the whole flight so the plane isn't to bright. We got served a Indian lamb or chicken dish. Very authentic Indian food along with very nice Indian flight attendants. IFE stayed on the whole flight and they server a breakfast of chicken and falafel which was very good.

Couple Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to Chicago,2017-02-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,2.0,"  I have no complaint about the service we received on our flight other than the entertainment system was somewhat hard to use and that my husband could find no classical music which he usually enjoys listening to on long haul flights. My complaint is about the ground personnel for Air India in Delhi. Due to a mechanical problem on our flight from Kolkata we missed our connection to a Lufthansa flight in Delhi. Lufthansa could not help us book a new flight and told us that Air India had to do it. When we finally made our way to the Air India booking desk there was a mob at the desk, not an organized queue. Would it be too much to put up some ropes so that people could queue and be helped in an orderly manner? When we finally got the attention of a person at the desk she said we had to contact Lufthansa in order to rebook which was the opposite of what Lufthansa told us. She gave us a voucher for a hotel and told us to contact Lufthansa in the morning. It was now 5 am. The hotel was horrible. It looked to be still under construction. It was cold and in a noisy neighborhood. The breakfast was awful. We could not reach Lufthansa with the phone numbers that Air India had given us the night before so we had to head back to the airport after getting less than three hours of sleep. This time there was no mob in front of the Air India booking desk but the man who helped us was interrupted 10 times while serving us. He told us he needed a ticket number to rebook the flight. Why didn't the Air India woman the previous night tell us this? After we provided him with that number it took him 2 hours to make the new booking. Then we had 13 hours to wait for our flight with no comfortable place to wait since we were told we could not access the Business Class Lounge until 4 hours before our flight. When we were finally allowed to check in for the flight the personnel at the Air India Business Class desk could only be described as surly. I find it difficult to believe that Air India truly wants its employees to treat passengers especially those who have paid a premium to fly in business class to be treated so poorly.",Indigo,2017,2

We booked Air India for our trip from the UK to Goa because they offered the most convenient connection through Mumbai with minimal stopover time. It also offered very good value for money. Then I read the very negative reviews on this site and began to wish we hadn't. However our experience was very positive. This review is of the Mumbai to London long haul leg but it equally applies to our outbound leg. The connection at Mumbai is rather chaotic and involves a lot of different people stamping boarding cards and luggage labels to no good purpose after our internal flight from Goa. We then had a short wait in the terminal before the gate showed as open. There were no announcements at the gate then suddenly it was a hurry for everyone to board at once. No seat row priority. However we were near the front of economy so that wasn't a problem. Seats in economy on the 787 have comparatively generous legroom and are slightly wider than normal. Overall very comfortable with quite a lot of recline if you want it, and a foot rest if you have short legs. The flight was all in daylight, taking off at 07.00 and landing 11.30 (local times). The 787's electronic window blinds were effective in reducing solar glare and the cabin lighting made for a restful experience. IFE had a good range of Hollywood and Bollywood films, with a few recent releases and some older Hoclassics. TV channels in English were exclusively American shows, some well known comedies but the rest very mediochre. The audio channel has no western music, best bring your own. A map is available with various view options. On the outbound flight the touchscreen was problematic but inbound it worked perfectly. We had two full meals on this ten hour flight. A full hot breakfast soon after we took off and hot lunch a couple of hours before landing. It's a long time since I've had such good good on a long haul, full service carrier. Usually you get one meal and a snack. Drinks were served (with peanuts) some while before lunch. No more alcoholic drinks were offered but they were available from the galley if you asked. We had opted for a standard meal, which on Air India means some kind of curry. I found it tasty and well spiced without being overpowering. They had in fact run out of the non-veg lunch option by the time we were served but we were given a vegetarian curry with a seperate side dish of chicken curry. Excellent service. On many airlines you would just have to put up with what was left. Tea and coffee were served after lunch (tea first). Cabin crew offered water regularly throughout the flight to keep passengers hydrated. Despite this being a day flight the cabin lighting was kept dim and I was able to get several hours sleep.. Several reviews here comment on the bad state of the toilets. There were no such problems on either of our flights. Everything was as clean as any western airline. I suppose you might have a bad experience going into a toilet after someone has been ill, or made a mess, but that can happen on any airline. Air India has just as high standards of cleanliness as any other major carrier. In one sense Air India is like travelling back in time. The in flight service is old school full service. Nothing is skimped. Even the in flight magazine has interesting and well written articles to read, it isn't just a shopping catalogue. Cabin crew were uniformly courteous and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Air India again, especially on the 787.",Indigo,2017,3

Events as follows: 1) Outbound flight Mumbai to Goa - scheduled itinerary change, ie the flight was moved back - this didn't cause me a massive problem but was symptomatic of further issues ahead. 2) Return flight Goa to Mumbai - frequent scheduled itinerary change emails and an email for me to change to an earlier flight (by 13hrs). The changes reduced the window for my connecting flight back to the UK, however Air India said I would still catch the flight ok. Flight was actually delayed by 3 hours, consequently I missed my flight back to London. Air India said that because the flights were bought on different tickets they would not get me home. Additional flight purchased to London as a result. My hold luggage got to Mumbai but has been lost, hence, I have no hesitation in rating as Air India as a 1/10 and have since learned they are notorious, please be warned and do not be attracted by their headline cheap flights.

Air India did a poor job of queue management both times. Even though they announced boarding by row, they still let anyone board regardless of seat number. This is especially frustrating because the predominantly indian crowd on either flight seemed to enjoy pushing their way through while ignoring the line of people actually waiting patiently. The seats were uncomfortable and didn't have enough cushioning especially when reclined. It felt like you were sitting on metal when the seat was reclined. This made a 14 hour flight almost painful. The bathrooms were just gross. In the first flight, there was pee on the bathroom floor that did not get cleaned up for the entire flight. The 'cleaning' by flight attendants involved regularly spraying air freshener in the lavatories. On the return flight, there wasn't even a soap dispenser! The soap was in a plastic water bottle with a crude hole punched on the top. The entertainment options were a coin toss. On one of the flights, the TV simply did not work even after they tried to reset it multiple times. On the flight that it did actually work, the entertainment options in English were limited and outdated. On the plus side however, there were 3 meal services (United only does 2 on a similar length flight). And the food tasted decent. Not good, but not bad either.",Indigo,2017,3

Without toilet, food or anything! After this 2 hours they gave me just the boarding pass until Delhi and I had to run carrying my son and all the luggage to the boarding as this had started already. Really stressful! My son was starving and already to tired to eat. Luckily I ordered a bassinet in advance for the whole flight. When we arrived in Delhi we had a 3 hours stopover. And again they kept us 3 hours in front of the security check because of the boarding pass. No toilets, no food again - just hard chairs to wait on. I was really desperate as my son was just crying.

Moreover, the flight to Chennai was heavily delayed and we had no info from Air India while waiting for it. Seat was comfortable enough, I had better experience but there was room enough for my legs (I'm 1.83m tall). Food was actually very good: I opted for the vegetarian meal and it was tasty and abundant.

Dinner main course was one of the tastiest airline food I've had but portions were tiny. Starter and dessert poor. Breakfast was a joke - a small bowl of fruit and 2 cheap mini croissants. Tea was great. If you do not like curry, make sure to book a continental meal (Air India offer western meal as a special meal that can be pre-booked). Cabin crew were courteous and did a good job.

Having read the other reviews online, which are less than flattering, I booked with hesitation. Overall, the experience wasn't nearly as horrifying as I'd expected. The flight was comfortable, the seat and legroom was great (and I'm over 6 feet tall); Economy class has an amazing seat pitch on the Air India Dreamliner. Since my flight arrived in Delhi in the evening, and the connecting flight to Paris left in the afternoon the following day, I got a hotel voucher when I departed Sydney (mind you, I had to specifically ask for it at the gate). Customs at Delhi is fussy, and it all feels quite rushed and disorderly, but the hotel room was comfortable and came with dinner, breakfast and lunch included (again, they don't tell you this, but if you ask, you can have all three). Service onboard was absolutely awful on the SYD–DEL leg, but acceptable on the other three legs of the full journey. Flight attendants on the first leg were rude, cold, unfriendly, was absolutely unprofessional. Entertainment options are pretty average; ugly UI and a dismal range of options, but I had my iPad to keep me busy. Food was great from Sydney to Delhi, but every other journey was pretty poor. Cold rock-hard bread buns, meat of questionable origin, and sometimes I just got asked ""vegetarian or non-vegetarian?"" with no clue what I was actually going to eat. Snacks between meals are a no-go, only peanuts and water / juice / coca-cola, which are self-serve while the FAs were just sitting in the galley reading a book. At the time, I paid ~NZ$1600 return to Paris from Auckland, but at that price, I probably wouldn't fly with them again. However, I see a similar offering from Sydney to Frankfurt for a trip next year at NZ~$1200 and to be honest, I'd probably fly with them again since the price is really cheap.

I had to watch the other passengers board and the flight depart, even though I had my ticket and passport handy. What followed was an ordeal. I waited for an hour before anyone contacted me to help me go back through security, immigration, and get my luggage back. The Air India ground crew were a mixture of sympathetic and completely uncaring. It seemed impossible to speak to the same staff member twice, and no one actioned anything unless I pushed and pushed. After 4 hours, I finally managed to clear customs and security. They made me rebook the flight for approximately US$300. I then handed my passport to the check-in counter manager and waited for my luggage. After an hour, I spoke to a new staff member, who clarified that nothing had been done yet. The lady I spoke to initially clearly didn't initiate any effort to get my luggage for me. This process was repeated three times, each time speaking with someone else. The last person I spoke to couldn't even tell me who had my passport by this stage, asking me if I knew who I gave it to, which was outrageous. At this point I was also worried for my passport, as well as my luggage. Finally, sometime after 6:15am I finally managed to get my bag and leave the airport.

We chose air india for our flight from Sydney to the UAE as we wanted to spend our star alliance miles. I am glad having spent only miles, would have felt much worse if we would have paid full for the flight. We had a comparably modern Boeing 787 but on our initial flight one of the in-seat monitors was broken. Business class was quite empty so we could change seats. On our next flight, one of the remote controls was broken, so another change of seats. This time it was only one of the headphones which was broken, and could be replaced. You could say we had bad luck, but we got the clear impression that the crew wasn't really interested in the malfunctions. And I doubt they noted them in the logbook for future repair. We had booked special menus, ""vegan"" to be precise. Now, usually our expectations are low, but with an airline from a country where there are hundreds of millions vegetarians, what should go wrong? They seems to think that butter and Greek yoghurt are not animal products, and the vegan main dishes were the most primitive and tasteless we had in a long while. The service on board might be a cultural difference (this is more a hint for others than a criticism), but the crew is hardly offering anything without being explicitly asked for it. So don't expect anyone to come and bring you a bottle of water during your 13hr flight. Don't be shy and ping them again and again. We saw other (Indian) passengers doing this all the time. The entertainment system : I don't remember any other airline with so few and so old movies in the catalog. Funny enough : two of them were Christmas movies - in April. For the Germans, some titles come with German audio, but you won't find them in the menu under ""German"" but have to try-and-error the English movies. Only once you select ""Play"" there are sometimes German audio tracks offered. We were very disappointed. The shabbiness of the plane and the uninspired, almost reluctant service is not a financial problem, it's an attitude issue.",Indigo,2016,4

Many places, they put duct tape to cover the cracks below the entertainment system and tray. Just within three hours into the flight, the toilets were very smelly. The food was ok.

My son from Toronto, called Air Canada (same time we were still at the Mumbai Airport) and they confirmed it was a lie.

When my son called Air Canada, they confirmed that Air India is lying and it's their responsibility (as an operating airline) to get us to our destination. They wouldn't even offer us a hotel in Mumbai. No meals. Even dared to offer us refund and find our own way back home! Their plan was to strand us in Mumbai without being responsible for anything!

It started prior to taking off. We were on the runway for about an hour and a half with no announcement from anyone on when we would be taking off. The AC apparently broke down so it was hot and uncomfortable. Finally the captain made an announcement about the AC and that we would be going back to the gate to get the situation fixed. Another hour later we were finally at the gate. Instead of letting us get out of the plane, we remained seated until they ""took care of the problem"". After another 45 minutes we were ready to go. Once we took off, it took less than 3 hours for the TV's to shutdown in certain areas of the plane. Along with that, none of the power plugs were working. I decided to ask one of the flight attendants if they can somehow find an empty seat for me to at least charge my laptop (there were tons of empty seats at the back of the plane, where the flight attendants were lounging). Of course without even getting up, she concluded that there was not any place for me to charge my laptop. Besides all of this, The flight attendants left a cart of snacks and water unattended in a galley for the passengers to help themselves with. I have never seen this before.  Passengers were all over, even with announcements to be seated. Flight attendants didn't bother checking for seats being upright and passengers being secured with belts. My food tray was broken.

The food was bland, a spinach-based curry which tasted awful, and their signature bad bread. The IFE didn't have a lot of options, but the interface itself was okay. The headphones were sub-standard and not up to the mark. This was a big disappointment, considering that it's a long-haul flight lasting just a little under 15 hours. Service was okay-ish, the stewardesses just seemed to be doing their jobs. I felt there was a need for them to brush up their spoken-English, announcements were being made in poor English.

After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away.

The uncomfortable seats and subpar food were shocking, especially for a long-haul flight. The meal service was particularly disappointing, with poha being served on a 5-6 hour flight.

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Jodhpur to Chandigarh via Delhi,2024-08-01,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,5.0,"  India is very poor in customer service. There is barely any concept of good professional customer service. They don’t care about customer loyalty. This is even more evident with airlines as there is very little competition in the domestic sector that is now basically a duopoly between Indigo and Air India. I have had heaps of bad experiences with Air India and had to forego many flights when they change schedule. When they change schedule and it does not suit you they refuse to provide you a refund and you lose the money. I preferred Indigo as I found the service good and had no problems until recently. I had booked return flights IXC-JDH in early July to fly in late August. A week ago on checking my bookings on their app I found they had changed my inbound flight from JDH to IXC from a layover in JAI to DEL. No issue with that. However there was no message or email from the airline of the change. I just happened to find out while going through my booking on the app. Not only that, the timing was changed from 1125 to 0925 hours. Had I not checked I would have missed my flight. As the new time was not suitable to me I called the airline. I was able to change to a later time. However I was told I must pay a change fee of INR 2000 per ticket. You change schedule and expect the customer to pay for it? I explained to the agent that this is an Involuntary change and I must not have to pay for it. The agent put me on hold to get an authorisation. I was able to amend the time without having to cough up the unreasonable charge. In such instances the agents should not require to get authorisation. They should be authorised to amend without wasting time on either end. Now after a week, I find out they have once again made a schedule change. They have now moved my flight from JDH to 1450 from 1025. I will arrive in DEL at 1625. However they have not amended my connecting flight DEL-IXC. That is scheduled at 1505, which will land in IXC before I even arrive in DEL. So I am back on the phone to Indigo. I requested them to put me on their DEL-IXC flt at 1725. Once again they are unable to do that. Was advised they will check and call me back. Got a call they are unwilling to put me on that flight. They want me to take a 5 hour layover in Delhi and arrive in IXC at 2230 instead of my original booked flight at 1500 hours. I once again pleaded my case. Was told they will check call me again. Again refused, obviously that is a peak hour flight and they would rather sell at a premium and let us helpless passengers waste time at the transit airport. No empathy at all. There is no recourse, either take it or leave it. I find this totally unacceptable and very poor service. ",Indigo,2024,8

They no longer provide fragile stickers, which is concerning for passengers with fragile items in their luggage. Additionally, considering it's an international flight, the basic fare does not include any complimentary meals or drinks. Even water is not provided unless specifically requested. The in-flight services are also overpriced, with a simple dish like poha costing over 300 rupees. Furthermore, there are no pillows or blankets provided, making the presence of five or six cabin crew members seem unnecessary if they are not providing any services.

First, the codeshare with Turkish does not work properly (it is impossible to make the web check-in online and to choose seats, we have to wait until we arrive at the airport). The schedule of this flight is very unconfortable, making us impossible to have a hotel breakfast before boarding. We had 1 hour delay and not a single cabin announcement to explain it. The captain was unable to make any announcement except a brief incomprehensible announcement just before landing. The onboard entertainment was not working and we had to make the whole journey with a white screen, without any idea of the time and our position. The stewardesses distributed water generously, but instead of a meal, I received only a tiny portion of vegetable curry. I was so hungry that I had to rush into a turkish restaurant at the Istanbul airport. The stewardesses are nice, but they still wear the ridiculous ""Girl power"" badge.

Having travelled today, at the check in counter, the staff tells me that there is no baggage advantage and I will get priority boarding.

And worst of all I lost my checked in luggage once I arrived in Istanbul. That has never happened in all my 25 years of frequent travel. All of those reviews you've seen about lost luggage & bad customer service with Indigo are completely true. Their cheap fare is not worth it.

Lack of flexibility and customer orientation on this airline is consistently staggeringly bad. And it really irritates my sense of efficiency and reasonableness.",Indigo,2018,4

We got to Indigo counter at 43mins prior. However we were denied for boarding as we were 2 mins late and were asked to pay difference of 10500Rs for next flight. We tried requesting the ground staff but they were arrogant and didn't show any respect or courtesy. It seemed like we have to live on their mercy to get on board to get back to Bombay. As it was way below self respect we decided to book another flight with Air India and got back home. It was most inferior action by the Indigo staff which could have been avoided.,Indigo,2017,2

We had requested a wheelchair for our mother and whilst getting off the aeroplane as we approached the gate, we were advised to go back and sit. As the passengers were coming through the passage we couldn't make our way back to the seats. The air hostesses were extremely rude, repeatedly asked us to go back to the seats although there was no possible way to get back to the seats. They were just not willing to listen and talking in an extremely humiliating tone. They asked us all to leave behind our mother with one person which made the rest of us further anxious. In summary an extremely annoying experience, air hostesses who are expected to be kind and helpful were extremely rude, intolerant and unwilling to listen.",Indigo,2017,8

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Mumbai,2017-05-01,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,"  Delhi to Mumbai on Indigo Airbus A321. Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again? Maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap, but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead.",Indigo,2017,5

Cabin space and seating arrangement is better than others. Overall ambience was pleasant.

I prefer a low-cost flight on this route as the journey time is just 2 hrs. IndiGo is not a full-service carrier but one thing is for sure if you are booking an IndiGo flight be sure that you reach on time. They have a record of on time departures. The ground crew and cabin crew is well-trained and swift and helpful. The only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system. The magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in India for a vacation or a tour. The airline connects almost each and every airport of India. Also they are flying to some international destinations like Dubai. They also provide free reminder service for your flight and the communication system between airline and consumers is way too good.

I am now 24 days latter, after 10's of calls and several tickets opened still not in the possesion of my luggage. Air India knows nothing, all they suggest is rasing another ticket. As the others I already have are closed. Not that anyone even contacted me once to tell me something. The sheer incompetence of this airline is incredible. I will take a moment here also to speak about the flight itself: aircraft dirty, not a little dirty but dirty in a gross way, like it was cleaned the last time a few years ago. Entertainment wise, 50% of all screens in the aircraft were not working, the ones that did had headphones issues, the perfect environment to spend 9h. This was the last time that I will buy a ticket from them and I really advice everyone else to not look at a couple of dollars difference and save yourselves hours of headaches. Customer support is inexistant, they answer, they barely speak english and all that they do is open tickets that they close themselves probably to look good in statistics as none of my tickets got any answer, or at least an automatic email saying that your ticket is closed.

The airline kept on changing the time without any notice. My initial layover was five hours at airport which eventually led a twelve hour stay in an airport. Once I reached my destination and contacted the customer care, they wouldn’t help me out with the whole thing, instead they said they will contact me back vey soon. Till this day they haven’t. This is not the first time I’m facing the same issue. From my experience never choose Air India, the service is just getting worse and worse. No sense of customer satisfaction or helping them. To say the airport staff are just communalists. Even though they know a person don’t know Hindi they just keep forcing and shoving Hindi on to your face. I have called the customer service more than five times still these company does not give a damn about there passengers. Flying on Air India is just useless and you won’t be able to reach your destination on time. If anyone need to reach a destination on time go for a different flight.

No idea how this airline can be part of Star Alliance with their standard being so far behind. Almost all entertainment screens were broken - dirty floor and seats with stains - no water or toilet paper in the toilets - horrible food especially for people who can't handle spicy or lentils well - seats in A320 ridiculously close to each other, got constantly slammed by the guy in front of me. This felt even worse than Ryanair but they're at least cheap, also there was no entertainment on 4hr flight - security at Delhi Airport steals your vape and lighter even if you just transit but let's you pass with a custom half liter bottle with an unknown substance? I have no understanding for this behaviour at all, Security also was unfriendly and arrogant. Absurdly high fees for change of flight data if ticket not eligible for online change (360€ for 1 day later), might be like this with other carriers as well but I don't like it. Actually the only good thing I can say is that you can take 2 big suitcases while Air France, KLM, Lufthansa ... try to rip you off here and offer long distance flight fares even without any luggage which messes up the results of flight search engines. I will avoid both Indian airports and Air India in the future, that was by far the lowest standard I have ever experienced by an airline flying to Europe. ",Vistara,2024,8

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to Chandigarh,2023-12-01,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," The Airline was on a downhill spiral since almost 16 years if not more. When the Tata's took over people had high hope for its recovery. However even after 28 months things are as bad if not worse. I avoid flying this airline and rarely do unless I have no better options. It's a big let down for a Tata company. I do not know if there is any other business in this group that is anywhere even close to as bad as Air India is now. I also feel one reason the airline cannot improve is due to the guy at the top Campbell Wilson. This guy has a lot of management experience but most is for a budget airline and he is trying to run it in that manner. Just a recent example is the reduction of baggage allowance for domestic flights to 16 kgs for Economy passengers. This guy says this is in line with the industry trend. Well I don't think so unless he is comparing with the budget airlines. Even Japan Airlines offers 2x 23 kgs on its domestic flights. So what is the difference between AI and the other budget airlines, offering the same 15 kgs. In my recent case they advanced the timing of my flight which did not suit me as it did not give me enough time to connect with my Inbound flight from Tokyo. I called and pleaded that the new timing will not suit me and therefore I wish to cancel. I was told that I can cancel but there will be no refund. I have never had issues with their Star Alliance partner airlines when they change flight timings and I get a full refund in case of cancellation. Not only Star Alliance but numerous airlines with One World and Sky Team offer a full refund if new flight timings do not suit. Obviously this is another similarity with Budget Airlines. I definitely cannot recommend this airline in it's current avatar unless there is a drastic change which I do not see happening any time soon, definitely not under a CEO who is trying to run it as a budget airline. I also understand that the airline is currently at a loss. However with poor management and bad decisions they are losing further loyalty.",Vistara,2023,12
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Hyderabad via Delhi,2024-05-01,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  My recent experience with Air India on a long-haul flight from Melbourne to Hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, the journey was marred by a series of disappointments and discomforts that left me deeply dissatisfied.  The food served was not only of poor quality, but it was also presented in a manner that suggested utter disregard for basic hygiene standards. Packages were not just messy inside but also had spills all over the exterior, making the already unappetizing meals even less appealing. To add insult to injury, the taste was abysmal, and the quality of desserts was subpar, failing to meet even the most basic expectations. Moving on to the condition of the aircraft itself, the state of the toilets was deplorable. Broken toilet doors and malfunctioning facilities resulted in a pervasive stench that permeated the seating area, creating an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere for passengers. It's unacceptable to subject paying customers to such unsanitary conditions. Furthermore, the lack of inflight entertainment for a significant portion of the seats is simply inexcusable in this day and age. With technology readily available, there's no reason why passengers should be deprived of this basic amenity, especially during a lengthy 20-hour flight. Speaking of discomfort, the seating arrangements were far from satisfactory. Uncomfortable seats made the already arduous journey even more taxing, leaving passengers feeling physically strained and restless. And if the in-flight experience wasn't bad enough, the ordeal continued upon arrival at Delhi airport. The mishandling of baggage collection, with staff carelessly pulling out bags from the belt and haphazardly placing them outside, created chaos and confusion among passengers trying to locate their belongings. In conclusion, my experience with Air India was nothing short of a disaster from start to finish. The combination of poor food quality, unsanitary conditions, lack of entertainment, uncomfortable seating, and chaotic baggage handling has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with them again. It's truly disappointing to see such a renowned airline fall so far below acceptable standards, and I urge prospective passengers to think twice before considering Air India for their travels.",Vistara,2024,5

Well, more than uncertain. When we boarded the plane, the cabin was heated to around 35°, which remained the case for the first 1.5 hours or so of the flight.  The seatbelt indicator lights did not work either. This perceived safety problem was compounded by the overall condition of the aircraft.

I pressed the button 4 times and on all 4 occasions they turned off the sign from their end. Frustrated I went to cabin crew area where they were just talking. I dont have any issues with them laughing and talking , it is their right. My problem is why they kept turning off the help calls? I explained that the inflight entertainment did not work. They asked me to sit. 5 mins later, a lady came and said its a common issue and the fact that the flight is around 8 hours, I could sleep during this time. I told her yes I would sleep but no one should be commanding what time I do what. She said maybe I can give feedback as none of Air India inflight entertainment systems work in any plane.",Vistara,2024,1

The plane was supposed to have inflight entertainment but the majority of the screens were not working. Might be a problem in one plane but as it was the same on both flights it is most probably a systematic problem. Please prepare to have your own entertainment with you. The food onboard was really bad (normally I like the kind of food served in India but this was really bad). Take something to eat with you if you are foolish enough to go by Air india. The plane was dirty and even though the space was fairly good I would warn you for the not so pleasant flight. Service was ok but the limits of all type of drinks was not good (I only drink nonalcoholic and still there was limits). My travel was delayed by almost 5 hours and that was according to the staff on the ground due to technical problems at first and then after finding an alternative plane they needed another crew as the other had to many hours. When I asked for compensation of 600 Euros (not for a full refund) they changed the delay cause to bad weather and not technical issues! ,Vistara,2024,1

Then in the afternoon, one Indian friend helped us calling Air India, we managed to schedule the cancelled flight by Air India for 2 days later, on January 17. The plane we took from Delhi to Paris was horrible, dirty and old, entertainment system was not working, the food was horrible.

Now up to this point everything was a mild inconvenience. However the flight itself was what made sealed the deal of never flying Air India. For a direct long haul flight I cannot believe the condition of the airplane. The upholstery was dirty and falling apart held together with zip ties.

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Sydney,2024-01-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  A very bad experience. It was a 12.5 hr flight from Delhi to Sydney. Supposed to take off at 2:15pm on 13th Jan from Delhi. Firstly I reach the check in Counter at 11:45 am and stood in the queue. There are so many counters for air India but any counter is not for a particular air India flight which males is so difficult for passengers as almost every passenger is asking the staff is this line for Sydney or Dubai or London or xyz destination. Secondly there were so long queue that by the time I reached the actual counter 1hr and 15 mins have already passed by. So finally at 1pm I reached the counter and handed my passport to the staff so they can check in and initiate a baggage drop. While the staff was checking my flight details I just got an sms that my flight has been delayed by 2 hrs and will now take off at 4:30 pm instead of 2:15 pm . Then the staff had a look and told me since your flight is now delayed to 4:30pm we cannot check you in you are too early for the flight, go and rest and come back in 1 hr and we should be able to check you in. So which means I had already waster 1hr and 15 mins in the queue then the flight is delayed by 2 hrs; after that I have to wait for another 1hr then stand in line again and then check in my luggage. What a waste of time. 1hr later at roughly around 2:15 pm I went to the counter again to check and she said your check in was already open about 2 hrs ago and that the person you spoke to earlier had given wrong information. Finally I did a baggage drop and went further for a security check. After security we went and waited for boarding as now the boarding was only going to happen at 4pm I still had another 1 hr with nothing to do. I had thought I will be in flight already 2:15 they would give food but now the flight is late by 2 hrs so no food for another 2 hrs and they did not compensate us with any complimentary food at the airport either. Slowly some time passed by and at 3:45 there was another announcement that the flight is now further delayed to a 5:30 take off. This meant that there has been a 3 hr delay from the original scheduled time of take off. Then at 4:45 finally they started the boarding so finally I had some relief and thought ok no more delays now . Almost everyone was seated in the flight and at 5:15 i heard another announcement that they are waiting for 1 passe ger as they have not yet boarded the flight. 10 minutes the passenger finally came. The flight finally started a take off at 5:45 pm. After all this once the flight was in the air around 6:15 pm they made an announcement that the seat belt sign is off and they provide snacks in some time. Finally at 6:45 they provided snacks and drinks.  Also from the time I sat in the plan the TV was not working at all. I informed them and they said they are serving food so they will do a reset after they finish with the food. They started serving food at 6:45 pm and finished by 7:45 pm . I told then again about the TV and they said they will go and reset now and it would then take 20 minutes to reset and come back up. So I thought probably by 8:15 at least I should be able to watch something . Once the reset was completed and I turned on the TV but still it was not fixed. Basically I had to stay for the entire 13 hrs flight without TV. I had no option left but go to sleep. first long wait for check in ; second flight delayed by 3 hrs and third no TV",Vistara,2024,1

Our luggage was lost with no support or communication from the airline. The lack of empathy and remorse in the way customers were treated is unacceptable. Seeking assistance from a supervisor resulted in extra-long wait times, only to be met with dismissive attitudes. Holding a grudge for asking for help is not the kind of service one expects. I had essential medication in my suitcase, and despite carrying only a 2-day supply in my hand luggage, the lost baggage left me in a dire situation. It's now day 3, and there's still no news on the baggage. Additionally, there's been no communication regarding a claim or compensation for the inconvenience caused. The airline changed/cancelled my flight without any prior notification, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience.  When faced with a modified flight, I had no flexibility and was forced to choose their option. Exploring alternatives was impractical due to last-minute expenses from other airlines and the urgency of an expiring visa the next day.

I booked this trip (WLG to STV via MEL and DEL, 1st leg operated by Qantas, last leg by Air India Express) as it was almost half the price as other airlines on this route, but also because I wanted to give Air India a go again. Honestly, I had a very pleasant experience. The check in process, baggage handling, comfort, boarding, cleanliness, ground and cabin crew, food and service were all excellent - on par with what you'd usually expect with the likes of Singapore Airlines. Crew member Pranali on MEL-DEL flight on 12 Jan was particularly kind, attentive and excellent at her job. Honestly I'd fly this airline again.

The flights had extended layovers – a 4-5 hour stopover in Delhi on the way to Hyderabad and an 11-hour stopover in Mumbai on the return journey to New Jersey. This lengthy wait was quite arduous and left a lasting impression. Regarding the in-flight service, it was satisfactory, although the food served from Mumbai to EWR lacked authenticity and didn't meet expectations. At Delhi airport, I was pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and modern infrastructure. However, there was a noticeable struggle to maintain cleanliness due to some individuals littering, which affected the overall ambiance. On the other hand, Mumbai airport was extremely crowded, and I faced challenges with uncooperative staff. Despite my long-haul flight, 11-hour stopover, and having a sick child with me, both immigration officers and Air India staff were unhelpful and showed reluctance. Their lack of empathy was evident, with one supervisor even making a disparaging comment suggesting I 'try my luck' with immigration. This was a disappointing and rude response. I strongly urge Air India's customer-facing staff to undergo training in empathy and kindness. As a business class passenger, enduring an 11-hour layover with unhelpful staff was a significant inconvenience and a negative experience. I rate my experience a 2 out of 10 specifically due to the unhelpful and rude behavior encountered with Air India staff at Mumbai airport.

I booked an Air India flight to travel May 21, 2023 from SFO to COK to attend her funeral. My family scheduled her funeral accordingly so I could attend the funeral. I was supposed to land in Kerala May 23rd at 0700 a.m. in plenty of time to attend her funeral the same day at 3pm. My mother’s house is just 30 minutes from the airport, and I would have plenty of time to reach home a few hours before the funeral. But unfortunately, I couldn’t attend the funeral because the Air India flight was delayed at SFO for several hours causing me to miss the layover flight to go to Kerala. I explained my emergency to everyone who were responsible, but the Air India staff didn’t care about it and rescheduled a flight that wouldn’t reach Kerala until 7pm causing me to miss my mother’s funeral. It is important in my culture and religious belief to be present for the funeral and events following. How can I ever reconcile this situation in my life in my heart? The traumatic experience I had with flying Air India and missing of my mother’s funeral is still difficult to come to terms with. It took me a long time to even write my experience in this portal. Unfortunately, this wasn’t an isolated example of poor service on this flight. On return to SFO the luggage was delayed 2.5 hours! We were given the reason for the delay as “there was no baggage workers to take the bags off the plain.” Not only was my time wasted but my transportation home was waiting for almost three hours. This is completely unacceptable. I have been a frequent international flyer for years, on many different airlines, and I was expecting a much better experience with Air India since TATA took over. Disappointedly, my experience was much worse than ever before. I was shocked to realize that Air India doesn’t have a suitable plan to deal with emergency situations like this. Air India will not be an airline of consideration for future travels because I don’t trust their reliability getting me to my destination for important life events.

So I could not use my cell phone to pass the time. My experience was horrible and I never expected or experienced such a difficult flight situation.

Toilets were so disgusting they didn't even bother to spray the room freshener and our 12 hour 20 min flight was such a nightmare. Moreover, staff didn't even bother to help when I asked her if she can help me putting belt on my baby. She said the other hostess will come but no on came.

However, the food I was very highly dissatisfied with. They started our journey with cold baba ghanouj, and cold hummus with hard bread. That as a starter no one seemed to enjoy. Out of the Asian elders did not even know what baba ghanouj was. An elder couple behind me asked them to help me with their order as they were wanted veg only. I was happy to help. For the main course, it was an option between paneer or millet steak (vegetarian). As the air hostess was coming around to take our order, she tried to convince me and my family to order the millet steak saying it’s very good. I told her I would not like that, and I wanted the paneer. After two mins she came to inform us they all are out of panner and the rest of us will get millet steak. I was seating in seat number 9; I couldn’t imagine why we paid so much more for business class; when we didn’t even have a choice what we want as a main meal. The millet steak was so disgusting. Everyone behind me and towards the back of business class was upset. Finally towards our landing, we were served frozen chat and a “veg grilled sandwich” which was in fact only bread and cold squash in it. It was making me vomiting because it was so bitter and tasted slimy and tasteless. The whole food experience was disgusting.",Vistara,2023,10

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to San Francisco ,2023-09-01,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,2.0," My family and I have consistently had disappointing experiences when traveling with Air India. This time, it was my parents' first trip from New Delhi to San Francisco, leaving much to be desired. I had explicitly booked extra legroom seats for my parents, as it was a gruelling 16-hour flight, and I paid for these seats when I booked the tickets. However, upon boarding the plane, my parents were assigned seats in the middle section, as the extra legroom seats they had paid for had been given to other passengers who made a last-minute payment for those seats at the airport. This was not an isolated incident. A similar situation occurred in 2022 when my husband and brother traveled from New Delhi to San Francisco. To their surprise, their extra legroom seats were also sold to other passengers during check-in. It's evident that this is not a mere mistake but a recurring issue. It's deeply concerning that Air India's ground staff and crew members seem complicit in this practice. It appears they are profiting from this by allowing passengers to book extra legroom seats online, only to resell the same seats for additional rupees to other passengers during check-in. My parents were left with no other options, and the crew members displayed extreme rudeness by suggesting that my parents deboard and resolve the issue at the check-in counter. This is a clear indication that there's a systemic problem within Air India, and this practice is tarnishing the airline's reputation. To make matters worse, I applied for a refund, but Air India never refunded the money my parents paid for these extra legroom seats. This entire experience has left us deeply disappointed and frustrated, and it raises serious questions about the integrity and customer service standards of Air India. Such practices are unethical and damaging to the airline's reputation. Air India must take immediate action to rectify these issues and ensure that passengers receive the services they pay for and are entitled to.",Vistara,2023,9

To begin with, the aircraft on both journeys appeared to be in a state of disrepair. The seats were worn out, uncomfortable, and lacked proper cushioning. The tray tables were broken in several instances, making it difficult to utilize them for any purpose. The in-flight entertainment system, or lack thereof, was another major issue. On both flights, the screens were either malfunctioning or next to non-existent. My family was left with no entertainment options during the entire duration of the journey, which was particularly disheartening considering the long hours spent onboard. Moreover, the meal service on these flights was subpar. The food quality was far from satisfactory, with unappetizing taste and limited options. As a vegetarian, I found the lack of suitable choices even more disappointing. It is essential to ensure that passengers are adequately catered to, especially during long-haul flights, where a comfortable and satisfying meal can significantly improve the overall experience.",Vistara,2023,6

We fought for some rest and sleep for lounge access. None was given, after much argument. Only a veg lunch voucher was given, estimated 450rp per person (there were 3 of us). In all of this no one apologised. The duty personnel in Changi Airport on the 9th past midnight to early morning 8.30am at the gate were hopeless and offered no sympathy or help.

It was all left to Changi Airport staff to assist (and they were also clueless what was happening.  We were lied that we were to be placed on the 2.40am SQ flight to Delhi.

As a common traveler, I can easily understand that 4:00 pm flight being very important for travelers who connect to other international flights from Delhi. There should be alternative arrangements to make people catch the connecting flights. If it was known that 4:00 pm flight is going to be delayed and there is no other flight available until 6:00 pm, why efforts were not made to accommodate few passengers who have connections in earlier 3:30 pm We had to cancel all arrangements made for their pick up and re-book the car with driver from Tokyo. Upon communication with AI they just offered apology. But, didn’t even bother to promise improvements. If it continues like this, AI would soon lose their customer base. AI management should seriously think about their ground services and delays which cost their customers a huge amount of money.",Vistara,2023,8

Business,Economy Class,Dubai to Kochi,2023-07-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,3.0,"  Disappointing Experience. I recently traveled on Air India from Cochin to Dubai on July 12th, and returned from Dubai to Cochin on July 17th. I am writing to express my disappointment with the overall experience and share my feedback regarding the flight. When I booked my tickets, I had high expectations, considering that Tata Group had taken over Air India. However, I was disheartened to discover that the flight experience was no different from a low-budget airline, especially when compared to the services provided by airlines like Emirates or Qatar Airways. It was quite disconcerting to find that Air India, which is still considered a low-cost carrier, had higher prices compared to other budget airlines. Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention an incident that occurred during my return journey. During check-in, I had checked in baggage weighing 26.5 kg and carried a hand luggage of 7 kg. At no point during the check-in process did the counter staff inform me that there was an opportunity to accommodate an additional 4 kg of weight, which would have allowed me to make purchases from the duty-free area. Instead, I was informed just before boarding that there would be a weight check, and any excess weight would be subject to an additional charge of 50 dirhams per kilogram. This approach to charging passengers for excess weight without prior information or the chance to adjust the baggage is disheartening, especially considering the concept of making money seems to overshadow the overall passenger experience. To comply with the sudden weight restriction, I had to rush back to the duty-free area and drop the items I had purchased. I was warned by your staff that I might face deportation if I delayed the process. As a Gold member of Qatar Airways, I am familiar with the rules and consequences of deportations, so I complied without any arguments and quickly resolved the issue. This incident has left a significant impact on my perception of Indian airlines. I now question the level of service and commitment to passenger comfort offered by airlines, whether it is Air India under Tata ownership or any other Indian carrier. The flight experience itself was underwhelming, with seats resembling those found on ordinary buses, causing discomfort and subsequent back pain. Considering the recent acquisition by Tata Group, I had hoped for a significant improvement in Air India's services, but unfortunately, it seems that Air India remains unchanged. It is disheartening to witness a lack of luxury or any additional features that are commonly associated with globally recognized and exclusive airlines. This experience has left me deeply disappointed, and I feel compelled to share my concerns with you. I hope that my feedback can serve as a catalyst for necessary improvements in your services and customer experience. As a frequent traveler, I believe it is essential for airlines to prioritize passenger comfort, communication, and transparency to build a positive reputation. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I sincerely hope that Air India will take necessary steps to enhance its services in the future. ",Vistara,2023,7

TSA crew at Newark Airport weren't the friendliest bunch, and their impatience with non-English speakers was a real downer. Unfortunately, the plane was showing its age.

Upon landing in Chennai, we faced the dreaded baggage problem. Our checked-in bags seemed to have gone on their own adventure somewhere else. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, the Air India representatives finally approached us. They were polite, but there was something off about their response. I couldn't shake the feeling that they weren't entirely transparent with us. But an Air India staff member at the Chennai airport handled the situation with kindness, efficiency, and a determination to sort things out. His professionalism left a lasting impression on me.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Newark via Delhi,2023-06-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug. After avoiding Air India like a plague for years, I decided to travel with Air India. Well the first time from SFO-CCU and back wasn’t bad. However, as the years have progressed, Air India has gotten progressively worse. Yes, Air India seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of Tata. Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats). However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever! However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in.",Vistara,2023,6

I do not understand who gives airlines (Air India or Star Alliance) authority to ask for passengers return flight? This is ridiculous and I hope my message reaches the right authority in India to take necessary steps to stop such nonsense behavior at the airport. If I still had option for travelling with Jet Airways, I would never ever travel with Air India. Sadly, Jet Airways is no longer active.",Vistara,2023,6

AI has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous. I landed in Delhi at 11pm and my plane to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3.35am. They said that it was delayed and will start at 5am. The staff made a big show of checking documents which started at 3.30am. Our documents were checked three times at least. Just to kill time and to make a show that something was being done! There was no order to the boarding! We boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane- a closed space, with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings. There’s no courtesy of keeping us in the loop. This is a broken down plane. Nothing works. For a 14 1/2 hour non-stop flight, there’s no entertainment. Honestly, at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get, alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time. We have lives and jobs to get to and there’s a reason we plan a trip. This is the second time I have flown AI in 6 months, for lack of finding any other airline and this is the second time I’ve sat in the plane for 4 hours while technical issues are being dealt with!

Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries.

The flight map was not available at all ! Aircraft cleaning could do with a lot of improvement. Check-in and boarding were good and the flight left over half an hour late but arrived ahead of schedule. Food served was average to poor - looks like some cutbacks have been made in this area. We had a connecting flight from Delhi and it is really annoying having to collect checked bags, walk through to a domestic check-in to deposit bags and then go airside again - nothing to do with the airline but Indian bureaucracy at it's best.

Most importantly in flight entertainment system for most of the seats was not functional. ""Attempts"" to resolve this issue was futile. The entire 9 hours of flight we had to sit idle with nothing to entertain us. We have faced issue with the in flight entertainment system before too, with the handset on the previous flight being broken and unusable. Additionally the food was tasteless.

The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good.

We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation.

The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok.

It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

Who is going to take accountability for our loss? Why penalize people that trusted your company? The customer service people are useless and not able to get a manager even after calling so many times; Their turn-around time is supposed to be 1 to 4 hours and still no call even after 6+ hours. Why no punishment for not-following process and procedure? Why make civilians cry for selecting this air-line? Why not take responsibility to make alternate arrangements for cancelled flights based on needs? Air-India is a disorganized, and a non-customer friendly company.

This airline needs to be held responsible for how unprofessional they are. We were with at least 7 others who were also flying from Srinagar and going to Surat. They were all allowed to get on the flight. We were physically held back. When i asked why they admitted they gave our seats away. Perhaps you can do that if there's a flight in the next few hours maybe. But to assume that we can wait 24 hours for the next flight is completely unacceptable.

I tried to book online but had problems and had to call about changing my flight. Although I requested English speaking reps on the 800 number, all the people had only elementary understanding of English. And, for some reason, they would hang up the phone in mid-conversation. I even had a friend call and the same happened to her. I ended up talking another airline to India and flying back on Air India which was horrible and I do not recommend it. I also want to warn people. My card was charged almost $1517.49 Air India admitted the problem was on their end but I was only refunded $1253.66 For some reason they decided to keep $264.33 That is the first issue. The second was the actual flight.  I was shocked that they came around the cabin almost 2 hours into the flight with a dixie cup of water. I asked if they had a larger cup because I was very thirsty and the flight attendant either didn't understand English or she pretended she didn't understand English, because she shrugged and walked away.

But he started demanding more money and n dollars. His friends came there too asking what’s the matter.  He told me that he took me their short cuts so he has to share the money thru the official thru. Wow Air India. Your officers don’t get paid that they loot us? Finally he settled for 60$.

The Upma & Vada served for breakfast was undercooked and stale. The bread roll was cold and tough as a rubber pad. Food didn't get any better on the 12-hour flight.

The washroom sink was choked towards the latter half of the flight. Feedback/complaint registered on Air India website, but as expected, there is no response (been over 15 days).

Welcome onboard by air hostesses was like as they are obliging me by allowing to board the flight. The seat was not fully operational with Digital screen. The handle/bar swivel was not aligned properly. Retractable desk was broken and screws missing and the hinges were with ‘wet’ adhesive. It appeared that they were either just pasted or wrong adhesive was used to stick the broken hinges/ swivel.  When opened the table, I was continuous holding the glass and water bottle, as it was not balanced, they were rolling towards centre. ( No turbulence). There was no connection to plug in the ear phone and the socket was missing. (I picked up ear phone from adjoining vacant seat). International flight of 14 hrs was not provided with sanitizer, face mask, eye mask, dental kit, shaving kit except the dirty throw blanket and pillow.  The newspaper shelves/ behind the front seat were too dirty and full of garbage.  The bulkheads had so many oily spots/ finger spots that they were not cleaned since many of the past flights.  Regarding welcome drinks there was no option other than Orange/ Apple juice or aerated water/ drinks and soda drinks. 1The digital screen had only 6 (classical) and 4 (recent) movies out of which few could not be screened. The map was continuous on “Flight Data not available”. Lunch was just like ‘Rice Plate’ available in Mumbai worth Rs 20/-. The cheapest desert, dried bun, no fruits. The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.  After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.  After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.  The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.  The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality. It’s a disgrace for me to travel with Air India on a premium category international flight.

This is the first time we are travelling in Air India. In air India even on a £800 ticket (there were 6 of us including a 2yr old, so £4800 in total) you feel poor and wants to get out of it as soon as possible. There were not even a colour pencil to entertain a 2yr old, I shouldn’t be complaining about that, should be glad we even got a seat (not comfortable though) to sit for 8hrs. The food was heavily salted and tasted cheap.  The flights were not on time (affected the transit time, so we had to run from one flight to next) but I not as bad as I heard before, at least Tata taking over has done some good. London via Delhi is not a good idea. When you come from London you need to check out and check in your luggage at Delhi again, so that takes min 2hrs in transit time (not to mention the porters and staff at Delhi trying to scam you) and you will almost miss your next flight of the first one was late to arrive in Delhi.

Paid additional price for booking XL seats for extra leg space but to my horror realized that these seats are narrower at the waist in comparison to a normal seat. Broken tray tables with cracks and stains, no inflight entertainment (for the entire duration of the journey) and a nonworking toilet added to our woes.

Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there) If you book a hotel and organise a transit e-visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. (I had to argue to retrieve my bag tag, which was a good thing as I suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised). The delay meant I'd missed the last train, then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass. Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque since I was already checked in. No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray. No other airlines have this policy, and mine was summarily confiscated in Delhi ""you can't take things that fly on the aeroplane"" — seriously; that was their rationale! Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom was the only redeeming feature. Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian war zone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping embargos. French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between.

Eventually, the person in the aisle seat in the same row took the initiative to inform the cabin crew to give me a blanket. Unfortunately, all blankets had already run out.

One might think its a fault so they'll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not. I have found this issue continuously. My negative review with Air India really relates to my lost luggage. There are no words to explain the misery i went through with Air India in trying to retrieve my bag. At Heathrow I was given a P.I.R (Property Regularity Report and a ""authority to claim delayed baggage"" form which i filled in. Alongside this I was told my bag would be back within 3-5 days and was given a online tracking link. In this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents, this is just one example. I wrote several emails to Air India and although i had responses none of them answered my question. All responses were exactly the same (standard) giving me different links. Furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered. After 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a Air India flight back to Heathrow. The bag never arrived. I only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days - basically my mornings were wasted This happened four times. It is only when i built up a decent relationship at Heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally. I called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered. When the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it - a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to Heathrow. I got to Heathrow (to get in to the baggage area is another story) and opened up my bag to find many things missing.  Thankfully some of the missing items were located (thanks to the gentleman at Heathrow who understood my situation) at Delhi airport. They advised they wouldn't post it and someone had to collect it. With the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items, however without the connections i would have had to travel to Delhi and no doubt would have been harassed. In my opinion Air India has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down. I have seen more negative reviews for Air India than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and don't ignore them but rather take them on board.",Vistara,2022,6

After flight booking I found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket, so I called customer support but its hours long wait time, then I tried US number which was picked up by a rude person who couldn't communicate in English or Hindi either, there was no resolution over the call. Before take-off safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws, cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand. Landing was very hard on touchdown. After landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt, hence we checked with Air India ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyone's luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport. The airline was managed by Indian government earlier, as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work, rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default, hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease.

I was told I can apply for a refund but when I tried, they always say we'll get back to you and no one ever does. I've been writing to them consistently for over 3 months. The call centre is hopeless and no one has a clue whats going on. On email all I get are automated replies and every time I follow up a new query is created and the context of the case is lost.

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Paris,2022-04-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  I was very disappointed by bad client service experience from Delhi airport by Air India team. First thing first was at baggage register counter was full with a lot of peoples because at the same G counter there was not just Paris flight register counter it was with Paris, New York , Toronto flight baggage counter . So there was a lot of rush it took us 2 hours to register our bags. And when we reach at counter the lady took almost 30 minutes to print our boarding passes . Then it took us 1 hours to complete the immigration process. We asked Air India employee to help us to speed up the immigration but he said we can't do anything then when we finished the security check. And ran towards our gate air India employee call us to come fast to boarding gate. We said we are coming but they did not wait for us for 5 min and can't let us in. We missed our flight. After that when i ask air India employee to help us but they were not helping us a lot.  I asked them to at least give me tickets for next flight because it was not my fault. But they said its completely your fault and we can't do anything for you. My wife was ill. she beg to your employees to at least help us in something but there was nothing from them. I asked to give us tickets for next flight but they said sir you have to pay 500€ extra for that tickets. Not a refund Not a coupon to eat something between the waiting time to get our bags. Not a single penny refunded and they are asking for 500 € We paid 500€ because we need to start our jobs. After that i asked them any help to at least a stay in hotel for waiting time but they said no we can't do anything. For me it's the first and last Air India experience. ",Vistara,2022,4

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Vadodara via Delhi,2022-04-01,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  Before you call AI Customer service - grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process. You need to call AI customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service. Not even basic greetings. The rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly. Couple of times I asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual. Once you have your basic itinerary ready, they will transfer you to billing department which can take only AMEX or Visa card. They do have few other options like net banking, Indian credit cards etc. When you are ready to pay AI, representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment - 90% of the time that doesn't work. With that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours, so you keep on trying to pay. Then I put my Credit card information and my India address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened. My payment was accepted and here I am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company. Finally, after all this I had a ticket to travel. Before the flight I updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information. The website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again. BTW they don’t have separate line for TSA APPROVE either on the airport. It is one common line at Newark Airport (EWR). Finally, we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal. The air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a child's meal so unfortunately, we don't have an extra child's meal. I am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so I convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal. I had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck. The flight was Boeing 777 (OLD) plane which has no Wi-Fi. Everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working. The whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system. After that only 10% of the screens started working. Now on a 14 hour long flight you don't have Wi-Fi or screen. The people who already downloaded from home are very smart. In short, have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight. Finally, we made it to India and felt now everything will be fine, but my misery continued while coming back from Vadodara to Newark. As we reached Vadodara airport, all looks good, easy going, all documents verified and here I am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge. The rep is saying - Mam, all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours, so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass. Did he say had written boarding pass, I was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security won't let me pass. The AI rep is no mam, it happens sometimes, and they know. You please go ahead. As I reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass, the officer was looking at me as though I am an alien and had I issued a handwritten pass to myself. AI supposed to inform Airport security about this so I can have easy transition but knowing AI they didn't bother to inform the security. When I said firmly that it's between AI and Airport security finally AI security showed up and resolved the issue. ",Vistara,2022,4

We reported this to the service counter for Air India in the  Delhi airport before 5pm. Approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at Delhi Airport. However, they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5. I explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldn't return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning. I even asked if I could pay to have it shipped to me in the states. She said she couldn't help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed. Then once I returned to the states there was no one working the Air India counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call. I called the Air India number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that I had to call the Delhi Service desk (the same one that wouldn’t help me when I was standing there, and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me). I told him I couldn’t afford to call Delhi and that I needed his help and he kept saying no, call the airport and then he hung up on me. We called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing. The plane was terrible, seats had no cushions and no room. None of the TVs worked and there was no WIFI ... made for a long 17hr flight. The flight crew were rude and wouldn't let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the Himalayas and I wanted to see them. When boarding Delhi to the States you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board (full xray scan and everything). The machine was malfunctioning and so they made all 400 of us stand in line waiting for an hour while they figured out they had to plug it in and we took off late because of it.

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Delhi,2022-04-01,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22. The scheduled stopover was 2.5 hours in which we had to complete immigration, check out baggage , go through customs and re-check in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to Bengaluru. There was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in Delhi. So we had roughly only about 1.5 hours to complete the above steps. Unfortunately, although we were able to finish all the required steps by 1:30 pm, which was the scheduled departure time, we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off. What followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller. We are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items. We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines. Travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited.",Vistara,2022,4

Finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch. The thermostat was not working.

It’s one of the most mediocre Business classes I ever travelled in. It is more like glorified Premium Economy. Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping. Inflight Entertainment: The inflight entertainment is laughable. If you are not Indian, you will have like 10 movies to chose from. TV shows have only one episode. No music to listen to. Food: Its typical Indian food be prepared for that. Service: They server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice. You will be asked for drinks twice only.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Chicago,2022-03-01,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  I have often heard of horror stories of international travel in Air India but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route. However due to a personal emergency, I had to fly Air India recently since it was the only way I could get to Chicago in time. Air India has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey. The tortuous check-in process with agents taking upto 15-20 minutes to check-in a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in Delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board. The aircraft was run-down and shabby, which was the second warning but the best part was when I reached my seat, I had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that I could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist. Of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 4-5 seats had a working IFE system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the Air India logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway, The seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests, I have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that I never have to sit in this seat again. This was not the end of it of course, the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 2.45 am, it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in check-in and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 5-6 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible. After this the crew decided to rest for 6-7 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own tea/coffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said tea/coffee in. Perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the IFE could not. Finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard. The only redeeming factor on the flight was that Air India is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight, it did not alleviate the misery in any way. The first thing I did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way I can put myself through such an experience again.",Vistara,2022,3

The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. The staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states “you have 2 options, you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.”  When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger, completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. I explained my situation to the united manager, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager out of her office. She stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional ie. broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C.  Anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were broken during take off and landing. Finally the plane was filthy, the entertainment non existent and the food terrible. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery.",Vistara,2022,2

Check-In Almost trouble free - the staff at Toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and RT-PCR test results. Staff must be trained to insert the Frequent Flyer number from other star alliance airlines. Boarding delay and nothing but chaos! There was no separate queue for business class. The counter was surrounded by passengers and the boarding was not started at the scheduled time. Smooth flight, great Boeing 777  and great meals! However, after the first 2 hours, the toilets were not looked after and supplies were not re-stocked. Extraordinary courtesy by cabin crew, very helpful to the families with kids and senior citizens.

We were travelling from Mumbai to Goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 KM to Terminal 2. The flight was at 9 PM and we reached at the desk at 8.15 PM. The Air India Personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in. It was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal. Later I have checked with many passengers who informed me that the Airline Portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal. Finally, all the personnel to whoever I spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport, and made sure that I should not board in the flight. Another harassment started when I went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of Air India. The booking officer on other side of the glass/window was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made. I kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to Goa. He somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls. I asked him what is happening ? to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets. After five minutes I lost my patience and left the window. Secondly, their call centres are closed after 18:00 Hrs. A recorded message will be heard continuously after 18:00 HRs that you are in queue, but no one will respond from the other side nor the IVR facility will be available. I travelled with Indigo so many times but the way they help me out during the distress is commendable. In similar situation at Chandigarh airport when I reached just before 30 minutes of scheduled flight, they made sure that I boarded in the flight with my family.

I had very low expectations, and Air India was as bad as I feared. The Indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible. Every aspect of this trip was subpar, and given a choice, I cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline. Here are all the ways in which they were bad: 1) Their web site is terrible, and it wouldn't accept my Lufthansa frequent flyer number, even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers. The web site also wouldn't allow me to request a special meal, and it gave absolutely no explanation for why. From some google research, I realized this might be due to covid precautions 2) I made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues. The amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of New Delhi railway station for their calls. I could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying. They supposedly entered my Lufthansa number for me, but as I could tell when I printed my boarding pass, it wasn't entered properly, and it didn't work. I had to claim my miles via Lufthansa after the flight On a separate call, the rep took my special meal request and entered it, but didn't seem to know, or didn't bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during Covid 3) My itinerary was IAD-DEL-MAA, on different B787s for each leg. I flew business class, and the product is really sub par. The seats are grimy, the upholstery was torn on one of the legs, the seat power didn't work properly. Worst of all for me, the moving maps didn't work on both IAD-DEL and DEL-IAD legs. Also, the flat bed isn't long enough for my 6'3"" height. The pillow they give is a joke. The cabin crew were nice enough, but I really didn't like the heavy/greasy Indian food I was forced to eat on some of the legs. The food on the MAA-DEL leg even gave me severe digestion problems. 4) Air India lounges were open in DEL or MAA, supposedly due to Covid, but other private lounges were operating, so it seems like Covid was just an excuse. 5) On a couple positive notes, all my flights were on time, which was a blessing, and the prices of the business class ticket was well below pre-pandemic business class levels.",Vistara,2021,3

Boeing 787's aren't that old but airplane felt 20 years old. Dirty and worn down. Food was very poor and I ended up not eating at all to be honest. Cabin crew was OK but not especially friendly. Booked emergency exit row so had LOTS of leg space which I think helped. Uneventful trip overall. Delhi-Mumbai leg was flown with a Boeing 747 that actually WAS 20 years old. Worn out and dirty. But good legspace also in economy and we were served snacks and drinks on this 2 hour flight. Landed a bit delayed and was 1 hour late out of Delhi. Enforced priority boarding on both flight (I am Star Gold) which is appreciated. Overall OK airline a good value for money.

When we got on the plane, the air hostess was rude and demanded I put my bag in the overhead locker despite just taking my seat and organising what I needed out of my bag.

(1) There were no blankets supplied in most of the economy. When asked the flight attended simply said “We are sorry we ran out. When the ground crew said they only had used blankets from prior flight we refused for your safety”. (2) the in-flight entertainment system was broken and attendants simply said: “sir this is an old aircraft so many are broken - too bad”. Many “low class” customers travel in the Middle East / India sector and don’t know how to use the system and end up breaking it”. (3) food. I traveled by Air India many times and their saving grace was always good food. But this time I noticed it was super frugal (just an entree and small piece of bread ). To understand all this I struck up a conversation with one of the attendants and learned some stunning truths. He said “ sir everyone in Air India is aware of the poor quality of aircraft, non-working in-flight entertainment systems etc. but don’t seem to care. In fact, we file a detailed report after each flight, citing customer grievances, key issues etc, but nobody that can impact the situation cares. Net, it is a leadership problem. There are no customer service metrics attached to senior operational leaders’ performance evaluations and hence the outcome, As long as India government subsidies with plum jobs, customers like me can refrain from using Air India but that will not matter at all as economic forces are not at play here, For those wondering, the fare between United Airlines and Air India for this same route was almost equal (United was actually $100 cheaper and Air China was 50% lower), so Air India does not have the proverbial price advantage. I also learnt 2 new aircraft were acquired for traveling public but later converted to Air Force One for political leaders. The older aircraft if used for fare paying public.

This was the first time I was flying Air India, and I have truly never used a worse mode of transportation ever. Air India has the worst aircraft with the most ancient entertainment systems. But that is a mere inconvenience in the harrowing experience that Air India considers to be an acceptable journey. After missing my connecting flight at Delhi International Airport, thanks to the inefficient airport security, and spending the night at the airport, when it was time to check-in to my new connecting flight, the Air India personnel at the counters were extremely curt, unhelpful and uncooperative about checking in my luggage that was already cleared from my previous flight. Upon boarding my next flight, I was welcomed to an unclean seat and food tray. Once I finally landed at my intended destination, Air India managed to lose one of my checked bags, which I was reconciled with after 6 days. This experience has definitely turned my family, friends and me away from Air India as future customers.",Vistara,2019,9

We chose them because they were offering the best times for both trips (but they changed them later from 8.40 in the morning to 2.40 in the middle of the night - and they do this apparently regularly). On both flights (actually all 4 flights because there is a stop over in Delhi) the online check-in was not working - as a result my family of four were spread all over the plane. In one case they booked as in row 23, but the aircraft only has 21 rows. So their IT is simply not working, everything is utmost slow (it took us 20 minutes to check in at the desk in Colombo). The aircraft from Colombo to Delhi is really old and dirty and this in combination with a non working IT, you don't believe that they really care about technical standards and safety. The entertainment system didn't work on both flights from FFM to Delhi. Every passenger needed numerous resets to get the minimum going - the minimum means a really small collection of outdated movies. I think even 15 years ago other airlines had better entertainment systems. This is clearly not acceptable. Sleeping was also difficult because we had numerious kids crying on all flights. The only positive aspect: some of the staff (not all) tried to do their best to solve the problems. So at least for us: never Air India again no matter how good their flight times are or how cheap they are. It is a shame that they are a member of the Star Alliance group.",Vistara,2019,8

First of all it was a last minute decision to fly to India regarding a family emergency so we booked an inexpensive flight and that flight was air India. The staff were rude to us and the the tray table was filthy and had bits of dried up food stuck on it, when I reported this to the stuff they handed me a tissue asked me to it clean up. You could have at least cleaned up the aircraft for the passengers to use and I take this offensive because hygiene is important to me. Next when we reached Delhi we were told to collect our luggage from the luggage belt and load it on to the next flight because it was a domestic one, this was the first ever time any airline had asked us to collect our luggage when we hadn't even reached our destination. At first we weren't sure because we had flown before and this had never happened so I asked the people at the information desk for help, there wasn't anyone else there but for some apparent reason the people at the desk couldn't see me I said excuse me about three times before someone looked up from their phone and when they did they were unhelpful and they looked at me like how could I disturb them from they're phone's.

Unfortunately, it ended up being Air India. I flew from Denver to Washington on United (Code Share) and then Washington to Delhi on Air India. The flight was delayed by a couple hours. Also, the boarding process was a mess. I stood in the line for like 45 min and then they asked me to get a new boarding pass when I was just about to get in, then put me back at the end of the line! I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi. So, I had to file a delayed baggage claim. The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn't enough staff available to help. Nobody knew what information to provide. After struggling for a couple hours, they filed a delayed baggage report and they told me I'd be receiving my bag within a couple days. After a couple of days, I called them and they told me that they didn't know where the bag was. So, I started calling them everyday. It would take me a couple hours of calling before they would pick up the phone. The phone operators never had any information about what was going on. One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore!!! I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report. But they never responded! After 10 days, I received a call from a local airport. They told me to come pick up the bag. I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home. As I had a family emergency at home, there was no way I could travel a couple hours to the airport to pick up my bag. So , I told them that I would be filing a police report for stolen bag if they didn't deliver my bag. After several hours, they called me to let me know that they are sending the bag with someone to my home. On Air India's website, it is mentioned that there is $50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours. I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation, but no one responds. I have been sending them emails every day without any luck.

Due to the short length of the runway at Mumbai airport and incompatibility of Air India, they always remove passenger baggage without ever informing them. They use a very common excuse ""bad weather"". So don't be surprised if you realize at your destination that your baggage was removed and never arrived with you. All other airlines are perfectly fine to land and take off from the Mumbai airport and you never hear any excuses from them. After realizing that you and several other passengers reached their destination without your baggage, the real fun (or frustration) begins. You will realize that Air India has only one phone number for their customer service contact which is the real deal. Average wait time to talk to a representative is over 60 min based on online search (I'm not exaggerating, in my personal experience these were the timings: 96 min, 118 min, 72 min and 130 min). Well after these wait times, you'll end up talking to the most idiotic morons on this planet who probably hate the entire human race. They no idea about anything related to Air India and no respect to listen to what you want, let alone help you. The frustration continues as these reps have no connection to the baggage department and then ask us to get a mystical ""complain number"" before they can look into our case. After calling the customer care for the fourth time, I was told that the number for US baggage department (973-242-0078). Now, I called them over 10-15 times over a period of two days and no one picks up the phone. The fun part is their voicemail box is full and not surprisingly you cannot leave any message or ever get that mystical ""complaint number"". Wrote emails to all departments of Air India including the baggage department. Still waiting for a reply. It's been three days and I'm looking for the lost baggage for me and my parents who travelled to the US and sill have no response from Air India.

No one had cleaned after the previous flight. 3) No inflight entertainment. Everything was broken. 4) Calling the hostess is a useless exercise. Don’t bother waiting. 5) The arm rests were broken and cracked dangerously enough to cause a hazard for little kids. They kept falling on them when they were trying to sleep. 6) They have nothing to offer little kids. No coloring sheets, stickers. Nope. 7) Had booked child meals and was never offered the option while serving. When I complained, they simply said “You should’ve asked for it.” 8) When I whined about all this, one of the hostesses said that she’ll come and take a look. She never came.",Vistara,2019,6

While going to Paris I travelled in Emirates with same luggage allowance and had smoothest check-in. But for my return flight they did not let me check in because I had one suitcase and asked me to either make it in two bags (which  I didn’t have on Paris airport) or pay for excess. Even on requesting and telling them I have 46kg combined allowance for both tickets on same PNR but they denied stating I have to pay if I am beyond 23kg or I need to find my solutions and come back to them for checking.

None of the TVs worked in rows 30-32 across all seats in spite of repeated resets by the crew. Imagine that on a 16+ hour flight. The remotes did not work and neither did the reading lights. So, I was unable to read as well. I did not see the slightest smile on any of the crew members.

There were 3 meal services offered on this flight (refreshments / lunch / dinner) including alcoholic / non alcoholic beverages so this ensured that satisfaction was there.

I'm a multi-million miler, and I'd be hard pressed to think of a worse experience than 15 hours on Air India. Not all of it is the airline's fault--but if you connect from a domestic flight to leave from Delhi, you go through seven different ID and security checks before getting on the plane: everything from accessing the terminal to accessing the gate, each has its own separate security inspection. I'm not sure what terrible people they believe would pose a threat to an airline which needs no help falling apart. At the gate. We were delayed several hours for reasons unknown and unexplained. When we did board, there was immense disappointment. The seat cushion at my seat was clearly from a regional aircraft and did not fit the seat, It covered maybe 75% of the seat area, and the rest of me was sitting on the gap or directly on the metal seat frame. The entertainment system was non-functional. A 15 hour flight, and it was broken. But whatever, it's 4AM and we've been waiting almost four hours to leave. It's time to push back. And we're back to the gate. At least the pilot checked to see if we had fuel before taking off. Because apparently we didn't have enough. And refueling took another 40 minutes. That hardly seems like a top up because we idled the engines for too long. And now we're finally on our way. The food served was...pretty dreadful. The cabin crew did their best, but the condition of the aircraft wasn't their fault. However, the cleanliness of the aircraft was indeed their responsibility. By midflight, all but one lavatory had run out of toilet paper and paper towels. The one lavatory which hadn't run out of paper had an actual hole punched in the bottom of the toilet, and was covered in human waste as it could no longer flush. It was probably the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen, and even worse, there were no alternatives--waiting another 6 hours wouldn't end well for me. The ironic thing is that the inflight maps show the locations of famous shipwrecks as you fly over them--which serves as a reminder that there are some journeys that actually are worse than flying Air India. Change here needs to start from the top, and run through this organization like an avalanche. They'll need years of good reviews and quality results before I'd consider them again, but I don't think they'll have that luxury.",Vistara,2019,2

Boarding happened on time and departure was ahead of the scheduled time which was a big plus. Once airborne on this 17 hour flight, the crew regularly looked after the passengers with food and drinks at regular intervals. At my seat the IFE was not working but it was not of any real consequence as I had planned on maximizing my sleep / rest time onboard. There were 3 hot meals provided on this sector with refreshments / dinner / breakfast provided. As there were some seats vacant I was able to slip back to those seats, stretch out and take good rest for 3-4 hours which was a huge advantage as I was feeling really fresh upon arrival which was 15 minutes ahead of schedule.

What a way to celebrate the international womens day than spend 5 hours with mom at the Delhi customs office, where we literally left close to midnight. This is after completing a 12 hour journey from Sydney on a flight with Air India. On the day that Air India was boasting about having an all women crew on all flights originating from India, My mother and I were struggling dealing with the rash, unprofessional and unethical officials at the AI office. This was my first and last experience with Air India My only reason to opt for this airline was because Air India is the only flight that was flying direct, allowing me and my pet to travel together. There were a lot things that went down that day, that showed lack to professionalism, ethics, corruption and misconduct. Firstly, my pet exporting company did not get a response from Air India till less than 24 hrs of travel , despite submitting all documentation more than a week ago . Secondly , I was waiting at the airport for least 40 mins as per the advice of the baggage team for my pets collection. After constantly nagging them for more Information, they told me to collect the cat from the cargo area without any directions provided to locate of the building. The Air India cargo group and customs office had absolutely no idea on how to deal with the import of a pet . There was a very obvious lack of training , and lack of knowledge of the process and protocol . All I saw was chaos and officials palming us off from one dept to another. Thirdly , air india mucked me around for another 2 hours before actually sending me to the right dept, all I heard throughout my discussion with them was whether I have an agent as they mostly deal with agents. I assume these are the middle men who get the job done. I told them there is no need for these as ACQS India has a well defined protocol that they should be following , to which that had absolutely no response apart from ""I should hire an agent. "" The middle men in India will follow the same process as what I did, the only difference would be some extra cash they slip in the pockets of these officials, who did not seem to want to do the job. I was also told that the server was down for maintenance that day, and the money has to be transferred online and only using the net bank of public banks such as PNB. The customs kept repeating that the Air India was not responding . However when my mom reached her threshold at 10. 30 pm and lashed out at the entire dept creating a a scene, the job was done within 15 mins. Air India was responding , the server was working and the money was collected in cash. We were given the gate pass to collect our cat and mom and I finally left the premises at 11 pm at night. This was my warm welcome back to my country. I can only imagine the loops they make foreign citizens go through. Finally, Air India has a vigilance dept, which provides a phone no. to report such misconduct and malpractices. As expected the number does not work. I do hope no one else goes through, what I went through I would not recommend anyone to use this airline after my experience.

San Francisco to Chennai via Delhi. This is the worst international airline I have taken ever.  The flight from SFO to Delhi departed 40 minutes past the scheduled time. When it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure time, the captain informed us of the delay due to some reasons. I wondered what stopped him from informing us of this earlier. They have the worst in-flight service. Most of the IFE screens are malfunctioned. Some didn't work at all. The selection of movies, shows etc. were so limited and mostly outdated. The screen resolution would remind of 90s experience. There is no organization shown by the in-flight crew. Some snippets from the plane - People would stand by their seat for an hour or so every few hours ; couple guys would stand in the pathway , chatting for 30-40 minutes. Not to mention that it created so much inconvenience for fellow passengers to go to restrooms ; group of 3-4 guys would stand by the kitchen and restrooms for couple hours and chat casually. Surprisingly, I saw couple crew members joining them as well ; Some people in their seat would never stop chatting , though it was late night. The entire thing felt like a typical Indian fish market. I had a connecting flight with Air India to Chennai. Since the SFO flight was running late, I inquired with the crew members about the connecting flight status. Some said it won't wait for us and some said it would. After we landed in Delhi an hour past the scheduled time, I ran towards the connecting flight gate. The flight was still there but I wasn't allowed to board it. I had 3 other folks who were going to Chennai. We were put in another flight that left 3.5 hours later. Of course, the drama didn't end yet. This flight was scheduled to leave at 7.55 pm IST. It was 8.15 pm and there was no announcement on the status. There were two AI staff members at the counters. After I inquired about the status , they made an announcement for the ongoing delay. We boarded the flight 45 minutes past the scheduled time. While we were getting off the plane at Chennai, one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry-on bag in the restricted overhead compartment. Most of us saw a crew member putting it there since we ran out of space. So unprofessional. My return flight from Delhi to SFO saw another hiccup. This time they delayed the flight because 7 passengers couldn't come on time due to a delay in arrival from Mumbai AI flight. Remember how I missed the domestic flight earlier and I was told that 300 passengers couldn't wait so they had to leave without us. But they could delay the international flight for a delayed domestic flight. Such theatrics could only be seen with them. This is the first in my experience. They let down us again with horrible food (no seasoning and bland). Refreshments were barely edible. I would say it was the worst food offered on an international plane. ",Vistara,2019,2

We were running all the way through the airport to the counter. They changed our tickets and surprise! We run back again to find out that we went back onto the same plane. We left Mumbai delayed, probably because of so many passengers running around the airport. Later, staff told us that the plane in Delhi to Copenhagen was going to wait for us because we were around 10-15 people going on the next flight. The plane to CPH was supposed to leave at 14 and we landed in Delhi at 13:35. When we came out from the plane there was an operator waiting for us to guide us fast through security checks etc. to the other plane which was waiting for us.

My collection of experiences reaffirms why this airline which had its heyday in the 70s and 80s is now the laughing stock of the airline industry. The staff's attitude is unmotivated and their approach lacks professionalism - they kept trying to take away my food and drink when i clearly hadn't finished, and otherwise wouldn't clear items when i had finished for a while. The chief purser only stayed in the 1st class section and never came out once to introduce himself or spend any time in the biz class section. The tray table hinge was broken (both ways of the roundtrip) which meant it was pressing against my thigh and couldn't be moved front/back. And the seat controls are atrociously bad - its hard to figure out which way its actually moving and the grating jerky movements make for a poor customer experience. The meals served was mostly lukewarm or cold and the staff didn't seem to care. If this is the experience in business class, i really dread to think what the economy class must be like. Clearly the airline strategy is to compete on price, not quality of service.

The interior looked rather deteriorated and service was shoddy. The tv was held together with masking tape, and you gotta hold it up yourself! The remote control had no buttons, basically useless, the touch screen was barely working and the remote was dirty. The chair was rough and it snagged my stocking. For each leg of my trip I had to call crew assistance once, and none came until the food was served. Only spicy food was available. Barely any crew service on the 7-hour flight, but on the 3-hour flight they offered refreshments occasionally. I got allergic contact dermatitis on my hands from the soap in the bathroom and I've only had an incident once before, from paint, so there is something very strong in their soap... so I couldn't wash my hands in flight (bags were transferred by the airline so didn't have the chance to get my own soap for the 2nd leg of the flight). Luckily, they had medicine but of course I had to go to their area for help and endure my burning hands, the crew were talking to each other that I had to say ""excuse me"", it almost felt like I was bothering them. They looked at my hands (there were no visible sores, it was just a bit red but it hurt so much) and they took their time. The 2nd leg of the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours, no proper notification and in possibly the worst airport ever. I want to sound impartial but there are really no better words. This is the first time I've flown with them and I can't recommend. I've traveled on LCC many times and not one experience was as unfortunate as this.

The first lie was a 2 hour delay, the second a 4 hour delay, and on the third 2 hour delay which then established a cumulative 6 hour delay - at least 60 male and female passengers were at the podium at gate 26B in the Delhi airport demanding answers or plans. Air India supervisors, who had no competence, leadership, organization, or plans were found to have lied to the passengers once one of the younger employees admitted they knew all along the flight was not coming. These supervisors engaged in a 3 hour argument with these 60 or so passengers and at the end offered nothing to the passengers at all.

The meal was not too bad, but unlike other airlines, the whole thing, including dessert is served on one crowded tray. The promised choice of desserts and chocolates never appeared. This is not a deal breaker, but just a bit surprising given the number of staff and the limited number of seats in business class. I think where Air India falls down is in its décor. Even though this was a fairly new Boeing 787, it looked tattered and worn. The colors, light tan and sad red, give it a dingy look.

The flight from Munich to Frankfurt was operated by Lufthansa, the other flights were operated by Air India. The booking was in one ticket. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt with Lufthansa was nice. When it was time for boarding in Frankfurt, Air India could not open the ticket. After a lengthy discussion we were finally allowed to board the aircraft (without boarding passes), which already had some 45 minutes delay due to our issue. Our seats that we reserved months ago were given to other passengers so we had separate seats. The business class seat actually is okay and so was the onboard service. The seat just looked dirty and used. Air India uses a new 787 on this route but they look like old 767 that have been in service for the past 20 years. After all, we were just too frustrated to enjoy them. Once in Delhi, an agent picked us up and escorted us to the gate for our connecting flight which we boarded without a boarding pass. While the Air India representatives in Frankfurt organized that we arrive at our destination, they did not think about our Air India flight from Goa to Kathmandu. Long story short: The agents in Goa could not find the ticket and we booked a new flight to Mumbai in Economy Class. The agents in Mumbai could see the ticket but since we did not use the portion from Goa to Mumbai the ticket was now invalid…and we bought another Ticket from Mumbai to Kathmandu. (By now the ticket was refunded and we received a compensation. But that was a long way.)

It is part of the adventure of travelling to India I guess, but in the future I will try to avoid Air India. It is just not a good airline.",Vistara,2017,10

She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row “be careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replace”. Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break. These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome. A demand for change of seats was declined too.

When I checked in Mumbai airport on 5th May 2018 I was surprised that the Air India counter person is asking me the Singapore visa. I told him that I am not exiting in Singapore and it is a connecting flight ( layover of 2 hours) and for such transit visa is not required.  My question how these guys are not so knowledgeable when they sit in that counter. In addition he is telling me United Baggage allowance may be 1. I told him baggage allowance rule will apply on the original flight rules and not the 2nd flight. So I had a real bad experience.,Vistara,2018,5

Although the airline uses new aircraft's, in my case it was a 787 Dreamliner, and food was good. I found the crew very impolite and the customer service was therefore quite poor, the staff did not share a single smile throughout both flights.

IFE at my seat was not working, I was offered another seat with working one (I opted to stay back as I wanted to sleep). Drinks were served with decent  options followed by hot food with vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, and breakfast before landing. Only thing which bothered me was absence of smile and courtesy on Cabin crew.  I understand the job is quite demanding but a little smile, thank you, please etc. can bring a lot of change. After all, the cabin crew is the face of any airline. Being 6 feet tall I had ample of space to spread my legs. Overall it was a pleasant experience.",Vistara,2018,3

You request the meal with your drink the person serving my section refused saying he will get it after drinks are served. I asked for a second refill of red wine and made the mistake of asking the stewardess serving the seat behind me.

Regular food was offered and the quantity and quality of the food provided was excellent. The seat was fairly comfortable, although showing signs of age which is expected when it has been in service for over a decade. The IFE may not been as vast containing 42738 odd movies like some other airlines but it was adequate enough during the trip and I even managed to watch a couple of movies but was unable to sleep due to infants crying continously and parents unable to pacify their babies but I was still able to rest for 2 hours or so and arrival into Delhi was on time. The remaining leg from DEL to BOM was on the star alliance Boeing 777 which was cool and a hot snack was offered on this route. Landing was on time and baggage was delivered smoothly on the carousel.

The plane was modern with adequate legroom between seats and seats were rather comfortable. The biggest problem I noted was that the Inflight Entertainment system were not working properly. I sat in one seat and noticed the jack for the headphones would not accept my personal noise cancelling headphones or even the airlines' own headphones. The stewardess working on the flight made an incredulous expression when I pointed this out. I ended up changing seats to another two seats. All of them appeared to have problems with the inflight entertainment systems. Some did not have the touchscreen working. Others did not have their remote working and others had to be repeatedly restarted before they were usable. The flight attendants did not seem too concerned about this problem. I had similar problems on the flight back. Many of the passengers on both flights appeared to have inflight entertainment systems which were non functional or dysfunctional and the Air India entertainment system in general appears to be by far the most user unfriendly system I have ever encountered of any airline. This represents a major inconvenience on lung haul flights which are up to 15 hours in length. The Boeing 777s of Air India do not seem to be well maintained at all. Otherwise the planes are modern with fair catering and flight attendants who do their job while not being friendly. There are better airlines to fly between the US and India, though.",Vistara,2018,2

Was a bit excited when I found out I will be flying in the  Boeing 787-8  to Kolkata, and from there, connecting flight to Dhaka in an Airbus A319. Check in at Delhi was a bit frustrating because their software were having troubles. So had to wait a bit longer in line. But finally I was directed towards the gate. The plane was prepped in time. While boarding the plane, I was recording video, but a flight attendant by the door of the aircraft gave objection to it. His behaviour was rude. He took my hand and told to delete that video in front of him. I was a bit shocked at his rude behaviour. But I did as he asked. He told me that it is against their policy to record video which I was not aware of. Still, I apologised. Nevertheless, the plane was amazing. The economy window seat which I got had plenty of leg room and great seat incline and massage options. Most importantly, the infotainment system of the aircraft was amazing. I enjoyed that a lot. The plane took of on time. After 40 mins, meal was served. Food was rice, chicken, vegetables, salad, bun with butter along with ingredients to make tea/coffee by yourself. After a 2 hr flight, the plane landed smoothly Then the connecting flight from Kolkata to Dhaka was in an Airbus A319. That aircraft was delayed by 20 mins. The plane had a bit tight legroom. The onboard served snack wasn't good on this one. There was dry, cold Singara and cake. The plane made some noises during the flight. This Aircraft, perhaps ,wasn't properly maintained.

Most of the luggage lifting and its arrangement was done by them (unlike other airlines). Special care was taken of kids and elderly people. The airplanes have much spaced and are comfortable. (Similar to business class seats of other domestic Indian airlines). When I sat on my seat I felt like I had upgraded my ticket to business class at no extra cost). Each passenger was served a fresh and excellent meal at no extra cost (unlike super over charged stale sandwiches from the other domestic airlines). I am a foodie so trust me the food was amazing. They even served coffee and tea to everyone at no extra charge (I pay 160 Rs to 200 Rs for one coffee with other domestic airlines). The ambience of airplanes reflects the Indian culture. You receive warmth, love and care like you would receive from any Indian home. I had a bad impression of Air India until today. The ticket rates are competitive and sometimes cheaper than others.

Earlier this month I reviewed the outbound sector of my trip, this review covers the inbound sector on the 31st January. Although the plane was a Boeing 787, it was quite an old one and hence badly maintained. The seat cushions had all of the comfort sat out of them, there were quite a few overhead lights which did not work and both mine and my companions headset sockets were faulty. This time, the crew were a little bit better but only very marginally so. We were given a reasonable lunch meal soon after take off, the cabin crew came round once during the nearly 10 hour flight with water and our pre early evening landing snack of a roll was so cold as to be almost frozen. During the flight our ""seat belt"" lights came on a few times due to turbulence but this did not disturb the crew who stayed inside their curtained off galley areas and never came out to check that everyone had buckled up. When we were landing, no one came around to check that seat backs were in the upright position (and therefore many were not) nor to check that people had buckled in. The cabin crew member who was a few feet away from me and in charge of an emergency exit, closed his eyes and went to sleep for about 20 minutes whilst we were landing. I suspect he was assuming that if we crashed on landing, the jolt would wake him up ! Does anyone in Air India care about the poor performance of their economy class cabin crew? I imagine not because otherwise these reviews would not be published.",Vistara,2018,1

The staff were dreadful, when pressing the staff requirement button no-one came, you had to actually go to the back of the plane and interrupt their mothers meeting to which they were extreamly rude about. They also made facial expressions and hand gestures about people on the plane. When they came round with drinks and food there wasnt a single person who didn't recieve nasty looks or sarcastic comments. The screen on my first flight was broken therefore I had no entertainment for the first flight, and on the second flight my partners remote didn't work on his screen.

Air India receives very few positive reviews and very many negative reviews - unfortunately this review is one of the latter ones. Our plane was quite new, possibly less than half full so we had plenty of room to stretch out, change seats etc. We took off on time and landed only a few minutes late due to stacking over Delhi. Eventually the inflight entertainment system worked after a couple of reboots although I would have to say that the choice of films was one of the poorest I have encountered on modern planes. So what was wrong? What seems to be the usual I am afraid with Air India - the flight staff who did only the very barest minimum during the flight and hid away the rest of the time doing nothing other than talking to each other. We were served a non alcoholic drink shortly after take off immediately followed by breakfast. Some people later had their trays collected, others did not. Five hours later the crew appeared again, served a non alcoholic drink and dinner (mine was barely warm and had to be rejected). Trays were collected and that was all we ever saw of them. If you wanted any in-flight water you had to go and search it out because no one ever came around the cabin offering anything. There were no inflight announcements about journey duration, route, weather, delay on landing. Four airlines fly London Delhi direct (BA, Jet, Virgin and Air India). I have flown with them all and whilst the Air India plane was the most comfortable and its day time flight timings the most convenient, the service was the worst.

They lost my bags at the Mumbai Airport, which is another terribly run organization and should be avoided at all costs. My bags have now been missing over 72 hours. They open a case through their Airport baggage organization, which is contracted to help Air India with lost baggage claims. It also allows Air India to evade responsibility and accountability. If you try to contact Air India customer service to discuss compensation / details of your lost bag, they tell you they can't help. They direct you to Bangkok. Bangkok gives you the Air India policy and tells you it's completely non-negotiable. They say they don't have the power to do anything, any changes must be done by Air India, and they direct you to call Air India. This allows Air India to completely evade any negotiation or accountability. So far as a business class passenger with no bags for 72 hours+ I've been given a paltry 50 pounds, about 65 USD at the time of posting. Should be enough to buy a decent pair of pants. If this company wants to call itself a premier airline, they need to go back to elementary school for customer service.

I went to the galley area to have some water/juice and had a small conversation with the crew, while I was standing they remain seated on their seats without showing simple courtesy of leaving their seat, stand up and have conversation, galley area lights were too dim to see anything and on one occasion I found all lights switched off (total darkness). They did not bother to check toilets, if there are toilet seat covers, tissue papers are available or not. Simply said, I don’t care attitude runs in their blood.

To double check this I weighed the baggage as soon as I got home and found it was just 0.5 kg in excess.

Waste and garbage on all desks as the crew didn't care to collect them when they saw them. I actually brought my own tray of finished food to the crew and saw them sitting chatting. No one checked your seatbelt, no one came round to make sure your seat was upright when the plane took off and landed. Conclusion: Acceptable environment, not bad food, terrible service.",Vistara,2017,11

They gave me a privilege to carry a 3rd piece of luggage for free, and Make my trip personnel said I don't need to incur any other expenses regarding the luggage while I was booking my ticket. While checking my baggage at Air India counter, the staff asked me to pay the tax (in Indian Rupees) for my 3rd piece luggage!  The Air India counter personnel don't accept Debit/Credit card either, and also they did not give me any receipt after paying so-called tax. I had to exchange USD for Indian Rupees and pay them while the flight reporting time was ticking at it's ending time. I was able to board the flight only because it delayed!

Delhi to Milan flight the aircraft quality is good, good legroom, comfortable seats, food good, cabin crew especially male stewards were good. The flight was on time. On the way back the flight was delayed a bit but mostly due to luggage handling. But a staff onboard literally threw the dinner plate at my fellow passengers, and when i had gone to submit my used glass of water her behavior was appalling. By the end of the flight the aisle was all filthy because the staff didnt bother to pickup the waste. There seemed a tendency to overlook and treat passengers with unprofessionalism as majority were Indians, but considering expats too were flying with us such behavior was a disgrace and not reflective of our culture.",Vistara,2017,10

No WiFi service on board. In-flight entertainment was limited. I'm a gold level flier and this was my worst flight experience. I reclined my seat and it failed to return to a seated position about 5 hours into a flight. After messing with the seat for 15 minutes, the flight attendant put me in another seat - only to find out that that seat did not recline at all. 15 minutes later, a discussion with the purser, I was switched with another passenger and found his dirty socks in my seat. In that seat, the entertainment system failed to work. This was a 15 hour flight that I flew business class and paid over $4000 for a ticket on. I would have rather traveled premium economy on United. The experience would have been much better. My complaint to the airline came back as ""yes, we agree that everything happened just as you said it, but you need to deal with it since it was a one time thing.""

Currently reeling under the situation of being sold off privately, the airline seems to be in splits as far as operations go. And my dissatisfaction started right from the check in kiosk itself, with the representative not from AI, but from a contract with the DIAL corp. The attitude this representative was showing unnecessarily was very upsetting. Boarded the flight with a half-hearted Namaskar from the flight attendant, something I was not expecting as AI FA's used to be the pride of the airline and a great first impression with their onboard greetings. This half hearted attitude stayed throughout the entire crew faculty present onboard the flight. No proper training given either; the methods used by the FA's to receive and give drinks was extremely clumsy as well as the attitude with which flight information was given. Food was also mediocre, not so special, but appreciated. No complaints from the flight timing, took off and landed before time! The aircraft however was extremely old, no personal IFE screen and the seats were not as comfy, not to mention dirty. While deboarding, the attitude of get-off-the-plane-already was present. Completely ruined even the last impression of the flight. Overall I do not encourage travellers to board AI, they don't seem to take customer reviews and feedback seriously to improve service. Price wise flight was great though and timing was efficient, being one of the first flights to leave the capital for KTM. Mind you, I've travelled with AI before too and was not pleased those times either!",Vistara,2017,10

The positives - there was good leg room on the seats, the flights departed on time. However the rest I'm afraid then went downhill. The cabins were grubby, I had to ask numerous times for a cloth to wipe my area and screen as there were finger marks of old food still on the screen. We felt that the crews on all the legs were all quite surly and really did not want to be there and anything was a bit too much of a bother. Once the meal service was done they all huddled in the galley and sat and read. On the transit at Delhi the ground staff were not much better at the customer service experience either, we were met with rude agents barking orders where to go as we had not heard an announcement due to having queued in security for an hour. All in all, not a good experience when compared with the other airlines we have flown with- Emirates, Singapore, Malaysia, Etihad and whilst they may be cheaper it may certainly be true that you get what you pay for but for us - never again.",Vistara,2017,9

As I opted for the veg option, the lunch consisted of paneer kofta with rice and vegetables with a bun, salad and kheer for dessert. The meal was quite tasty and filling which was good. Afterwards, the IFE kept me occupied for most part of the flight. The IFE was not expansive but for a 9 hour journey managed to keep me occupied. The crew dimmed the windows after lunch to make passengers get some sleep. Before landing, supper was provided which consisted of a samosa, veg cutlet and panner tikka with a bun, fruits and gulab jamun for dessert. Arrival in Mumbai was delayed by 35 mins. The seats were quite comfortable, the crew were a bit stiff but provided regular drinks.

That was exactly my experience - inconsistent. Not sure what to expect. DEL-BKK: Boeing 787, ample leg space, acceptable IFE, acceptable inflight service, helping and offering of drinks. Flight stewards did their job, all boxes ticked, nothing to complain-nothing to write home about. All these compared to the price I paid- good value for money BKK-DEL: Morning flight, same equipment, same IFE. But the only variable factor, in flight service, fell like nine pins. Type of meal I prefer finished by the time it came to me, since this is a morning flight, they were not serving drinks (never seen that before). When requested, got snubbed down badly by flight steward. Overall verdict: good for price sensitive travelers but don't expect much from service standpoint.

I have a large family and the cabin crew were unhelpful to say the least. The food (curry) is unsuitable for small children and they did not have a children's menu (apparently this is available but you need to request in advance, something which we were not told at the time of booking despite entering the ages of the children). Even if those are their rules, the cabin staff could have tried to help (eg with extra bread or a snack) rather than leave small children on a 10 hour flight with no food. The staff were clearly not accustomed to dealing with children and were constantly complaining when they dropped stuff (blankets, wrapping) on the floor (as kids do). One passenger had to tell them to stop scolding his 2 year old as that was his job not theirs (the kid was very well behaved). The flight from Delhi to Madrid was almost 10 hours and the staff basically served food, cleared up and then did nothing until about 90 minutes before landing when they served a very small snack. Anyone who needed anything had to go look for it themselves. On the flight to Delhi I left my Kindle ebook in the seat pocket. Given we were in the last row I fully expected the cabin staff to recover it when they checked the plane on landing. However, 4 weeks on I still don't know. The email for lost luggage doesnt work so I had to contact the airline and was given 2 alternatives. I have since sent a number of reminders but have had no response (the emails have been read).

Since advertising the Boeing 787 as their flagship plane I was looking forward to flying the aircraft for the first time. However to my surprise it was probably one of the dirtiest aircraft I have been on. Airvents had so much dust accumulated that the vents had turned black. Broken trays.  In my experience the airline had good punctuality in this flight however I would be cautious if booking with them to check for delay patterns. Staff are somewhat helpful however not very welcoming or engaging. Felt they were really there just to dish out the food. Did not get a single response from any stewardess on the aircraft on all occasions of travel when using the assistance button in seat. Inflight entertaintment is probably one of the worst. If you are flying I would suggest downlading your favourite shows or movies beforehand. USB charger ports were not working in my friends seat, so he had to use mine, while my entertainment screen buttons were broken (physically broken). Overall I would not fly with Air India again unless I have no other option.

There is more room between seats and the width of the seat is wider. Food is okay, booze plentiful and wide choice. No Noise Reducing headphones, which is normal in Business Class. They do not have their own Airport lounge but at Heathrow share the Lufthansa lounge which is nice.

Check-in at CDG was smooth and quick (web check-in). The Boeing 787 is a modern aircraft but the interior of this flight looked dull, although seat comfort and legroom were good.

The meals were verbally communicated to us. I paid $US2,000 only to be told what is in my meals. I had two small meals during this flight and each time I completed my meal the tray was not picked up in a timely fashion. I think I must have waited 25 minutes after I finished my meal, for the tray to be picked up. The flight attendants did not walk down the aisle as often as I think they should.

Once reached the NY airport, was asked to find a connection flight on my own from DEL. I had to put up an hour's argument to prove my point that its a last minute cancellation and would be difficult for me to rebook a flight from Delhi and it being after 7PM will be even more difficult to find any local flights. Now, I am not sure if i can take the risk of flying back in Air India as the last minute cancellations seems to be pretty common for them and asked them to cancel the return trip and process the refund. its been 7 days since i made multiple calls and haven't heard from them yet.

Couple Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to Chicago,2017-02-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,2.0,"  I have no complaint about the service we received on our flight other than the entertainment system was somewhat hard to use and that my husband could find no classical music which he usually enjoys listening to on long haul flights. My complaint is about the ground personnel for Air India in Delhi. Due to a mechanical problem on our flight from Kolkata we missed our connection to a Lufthansa flight in Delhi. Lufthansa could not help us book a new flight and told us that Air India had to do it. When we finally made our way to the Air India booking desk there was a mob at the desk, not an organized queue. Would it be too much to put up some ropes so that people could queue and be helped in an orderly manner? When we finally got the attention of a person at the desk she said we had to contact Lufthansa in order to rebook which was the opposite of what Lufthansa told us. She gave us a voucher for a hotel and told us to contact Lufthansa in the morning. It was now 5 am. The hotel was horrible. It looked to be still under construction. It was cold and in a noisy neighborhood. The breakfast was awful. We could not reach Lufthansa with the phone numbers that Air India had given us the night before so we had to head back to the airport after getting less than three hours of sleep. This time there was no mob in front of the Air India booking desk but the man who helped us was interrupted 10 times while serving us. He told us he needed a ticket number to rebook the flight. Why didn't the Air India woman the previous night tell us this? After we provided him with that number it took him 2 hours to make the new booking. Then we had 13 hours to wait for our flight with no comfortable place to wait since we were told we could not access the Business Class Lounge until 4 hours before our flight. When we were finally allowed to check in for the flight the personnel at the Air India Business Class desk could only be described as surly. I find it difficult to believe that Air India truly wants its employees to treat passengers especially those who have paid a premium to fly in business class to be treated so poorly.",Vistara,2017,2
Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to London Heathrow,2017-03-01,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1,8.0,"  
We booked Air India for our trip from the UK to Goa because they offered the most convenient connection through Mumbai with minimal stopover time. It also offered very good value for money. Then I read the very negative reviews on this site and began to wish we hadn't. However our experience was very positive. This review is of the Mumbai to London long haul leg but it equally applies to our outbound leg. The connection at Mumbai is rather chaotic and involves a lot of different people stamping boarding cards and luggage labels to no good purpose after our internal flight from Goa. We then had a short wait in the terminal before the gate showed as open. There were no announcements at the gate then suddenly it was a hurry for everyone to board at once. No seat row priority. However we were near the front of economy so that wasn't a problem. Seats in economy on the 787 have comparatively generous legroom and are slightly wider than normal. Overall very comfortable with quite a lot of recline if you want it, and a foot rest if you have short legs. The flight was all in daylight, taking off at 07.00 and landing 11.30 (local times). The 787's electronic window blinds were effective in reducing solar glare and the cabin lighting made for a restful experience. IFE had a good range of Hollywood and Bollywood films, with a few recent releases and some older Hoclassics. TV channels in English were exclusively American shows, some well known comedies but the rest very mediochre. The audio channel has no western music, best bring your own. A map is available with various view options. On the outbound flight the touchscreen was problematic but inbound it worked perfectly. We had two full meals on this ten hour flight. A full hot breakfast soon after we took off and hot lunch a couple of hours before landing. It's a long time since I've had such good good on a long haul, full service carrier. Usually you get one meal and a snack. Drinks were served (with peanuts) some while before lunch. No more alcoholic drinks were offered but they were available from the galley if you asked. We had opted for a standard meal, which on Air India means some kind of curry. I found it tasty and well spiced without being overpowering. They had in fact run out of the non-veg lunch option by the time we were served but we were given a vegetarian curry with a seperate side dish of chicken curry. Excellent service. On many airlines you would just have to put up with what was left. Tea and coffee were served after lunch (tea first). Cabin crew offered water regularly throughout the flight to keep passengers hydrated. Despite this being a day flight the cabin lighting was kept dim and I was able to get several hours sleep.. Several reviews here comment on the bad state of the toilets. There were no such problems on either of our flights. Everything was as clean as any western airline. I suppose you might have a bad experience going into a toilet after someone has been ill, or made a mess, but that can happen on any airline. Air India has just as high standards of cleanliness as any other major carrier. In one sense Air India is like travelling back in time. The in flight service is old school full service. Nothing is skimped. Even the in flight magazine has interesting and well written articles to read, it isn't just a shopping catalogue. Cabin crew were uniformly courteous and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Air India again, especially on the 787.",Vistara,2017,3

Events as follows: 1) Outbound flight Mumbai to Goa - scheduled itinerary change, ie the flight was moved back - this didn't cause me a massive problem but was symptomatic of further issues ahead. 2) Return flight Goa to Mumbai - frequent scheduled itinerary change emails and an email for me to change to an earlier flight (by 13hrs). The changes reduced the window for my connecting flight back to the UK, however Air India said I would still catch the flight ok. Flight was actually delayed by 3 hours, consequently I missed my flight back to London. Air India said that because the flights were bought on different tickets they would not get me home. Additional flight purchased to London as a result. My hold luggage got to Mumbai but has been lost, hence, I have no hesitation in rating as Air India as a 1/10 and have since learned they are notorious, please be warned and do not be attracted by their headline cheap flights.

The lady who refused me before was came to me and asked why I am asking him tea as she just told me to wait after dinner. I told her that sorry but I am allowed to have tea. This is a small incident. Dinner was served. It was a different lady walking through by my seat. I stopped her and request her may I please have cup of water, she was very angry. I thought she did not hear me properly, I asked her a bit louder again. She started arguing with me why I am shouting at her. I said I am not shouting you I thought you did not hear me. I would like to have cup of water for my tablets please. She never came back. Very bad service.

Air India did a poor job of queue management both times. Even though they announced boarding by row, they still let anyone board regardless of seat number. This is especially frustrating because the predominantly indian crowd on either flight seemed to enjoy pushing their way through while ignoring the line of people actually waiting patiently. The seats were uncomfortable and didn't have enough cushioning especially when reclined. It felt like you were sitting on metal when the seat was reclined. This made a 14 hour flight almost painful. The bathrooms were just gross. In the first flight, there was pee on the bathroom floor that did not get cleaned up for the entire flight. The 'cleaning' by flight attendants involved regularly spraying air freshener in the lavatories. On the return flight, there wasn't even a soap dispenser! The soap was in a plastic water bottle with a crude hole punched on the top. The entertainment options were a coin toss. On one of the flights, the TV simply did not work even after they tried to reset it multiple times. On the flight that it did actually work, the entertainment options in English were limited and outdated. On the plus side however, there were 3 meal services (United only does 2 on a similar length flight). And the food tasted decent. Not good, but not bad either.",Vistara,2017,3

The first problems started when they weren't be able to print the boarding pass for my son. They kept me 2 hours in front of the check-in that I couldn't care properly for my son. Just waiting. Without toilet, food or anything! After this 2 hours they gave me just the boarding pass until Delhi and I had to run carrying my son and all the luggage to the boarding as this had started already. Really stressful! My son was starving and already to tired to eat. Luckily I ordered a bassinet in advance for the whole flight. When we arrived in Delhi we had a 3 hours stopover. And again they kept us 3 hours in front of the security check because of the boarding pass. No toilets, no food again - just hard chairs to wait on. I was really desperate as my son was just crying.

Moreover, the flight to Chennai was heavily delayed and we had no info from Air India while waiting for it. Seat was comfortable enough, I had better experience but there was room enough for my legs (I'm 1.83m tall). Food was actually very good: I opted for the vegetarian meal and it was tasty and abundant.

Dinner main course was one of the tastiest airline food I've had but portions were tiny. Starter and dessert poor. Breakfast was a joke - a small bowl of fruit and 2 cheap mini croissants.

Having read the other reviews online, which are less than flattering, I booked with hesitation. Overall, the experience wasn't nearly as horrifying as I'd expected. The flight was comfortable, the seat and legroom was great (and I'm over 6 feet tall); Economy class has an amazing seat pitch on the Air India Dreamliner. Since my flight arrived in Delhi in the evening, and the connecting flight to Paris left in the afternoon the following day, I got a hotel voucher when I departed Sydney (mind you, I had to specifically ask for it at the gate). Customs at Delhi is fussy, and it all feels quite rushed and disorderly, but the hotel room was comfortable and came with dinner, breakfast and lunch included (again, they don't tell you this, but if you ask, you can have all three). Service onboard was absolutely awful on the SYD–DEL leg, but acceptable on the other three legs of the full journey. Flight attendants on the first leg were rude, cold, unfriendly, was absolutely unprofessional. Entertainment options are pretty average; ugly UI and a dismal range of options, but I had my iPad to keep me busy. Food was great from Sydney to Delhi, but every other journey was pretty poor. Cold rock-hard bread buns, meat of questionable origin, and sometimes I just got asked ""vegetarian or non-vegetarian?"" with no clue what I was actually going to eat. Snacks between meals are a no-go, only peanuts and water / juice / coca-cola, which are self-serve while the FAs were just sitting in the galley reading a book. At the time, I paid ~NZ$1600 return to Paris from Auckland, but at that price, I probably wouldn't fly with them again. However, I see a similar offering from Sydney to Frankfurt for a trip next year at NZ~$1200 and to be honest, I'd probably fly with them again since the price is really cheap.

I flew from Mumbai to Delhi to connect with AI314 to Hong Kong, departing at 11pm. In Delhi I lost my boarding pass, and alerted the crew at the gate immediately. They sent me running to the duty free to check if they had found it, but when I ran back telling them that I didn't find it, they told me they wouldn't be able to reissue me with a new one, and that I'd have to rebook on the same flight 24 hours later. I had to watch the other passengers board and the flight depart, even though I had my ticket and passport handy. What followed was an ordeal. I waited for an hour before anyone contacted me to help me go back through security, immigration, and get my luggage back. The Air India ground crew were a mixture of sympathetic and completely uncaring. It seemed impossible to speak to the same staff member twice, and no one actioned anything unless I pushed and pushed. After 4 hours, I finally managed to clear customs and security. They made me rebook the flight for approximately US$300. I then handed my passport to the check-in counter manager and waited for my luggage. After an hour, I spoke to a new staff member, who clarified that nothing had been done yet. The lady I spoke to initially clearly didn't initiate any effort to get my luggage for me. This process was repeated three times, each time speaking with someone else. The last person I spoke to couldn't even tell me who had my passport by this stage, asking me if I knew who I gave it to, which was outrageous. At this point I was also worried for my passport, as well as my luggage. Finally, sometime after 6:15am I finally managed to get my bag and leave the airport. This seven hour ordeal is not over yet, as I am writing this review from Delhi airport, 27 hours after initially leaving Mumbai. The direct flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong is only just over 5 hours. Air India have wasted my time, money, and have shown themselves to be a company with a culture of complete indifference towards their customers. I may have lost my boarding pass, but these things happen, and some understanding and assistance on their part would have been greatly appreciated. To add to my negative experience, two of their crew told me - separately - that they would have issued me with a new boarding pass had they been working at the desk at the time.

We chose air india for our flight from Sydney to the UAE as we wanted to spend our star alliance miles. I am glad having spent only miles, would have felt much worse if we would have paid full for the flight. We had a comparably modern Boeing 787 but on our initial flight one of the in-seat monitors was broken. Business class was quite empty so we could change seats. On our next flight, one of the remote controls was broken, so another change of seats. This time it was only one of the headphones which was broken, and could be replaced. You could say we had bad luck, but we got the clear impression that the crew wasn't really interested in the malfunctions. And I doubt they noted them in the logbook for future repair. We had booked special menus, ""vegan"" to be precise. Now, usually our expectations are low, but with an airline from a country where there are hundreds of millions vegetarians, what should go wrong? They seems to think that butter and Greek yoghurt are not animal products, and the vegan main dishes were the most primitive and tasteless we had in a long while. The service on board might be a cultural difference (this is more a hint for others than a criticism), but the crew is hardly offering anything without being explicitly asked for it. So don't expect anyone to come and bring you a bottle of water during your 13hr flight. Don't be shy and ping them again and again. We saw other (Indian) passengers doing this all the time. The entertainment system : I don't remember any other airline with so few and so old movies in the catalog. Funny enough : two of them were Christmas movies - in April. For the Germans, some titles come with German audio, but you won't find them in the menu under ""German"" but have to try-and-error the English movies. Only once you select ""Play"" there are sometimes German audio tracks offered. We were very disappointed. The shabbiness of the plane and the uninspired, almost reluctant service is not a financial problem, it's an attitude issue.",Vistara,2016,4

I had to rush home from a goodbye lunch to pack and get to the airport quickly, and then the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours from the new time. The fact that Air India thinks it's okay to move up the flight time at the last minute is a sign of their general disregard for the customer.

I was already on my way to Delhi when I received a text about the change and had to scramble at the airport to get a last-minute hotel room in Delhi, which the airline did not compensate me for.

Flight left on time, the service was friendly with many smiles, seats comfortable, clean cabin (don't know about the toilets), drinks followed by dinner was better than average, water offered every hour or so during the flight. The only negative is that the movies were dated - but I was okay with a re-run of Batman, which just about put me to sleep.

The lie flat bed in business was excellent. Much more spacious than the United product or the Smartium business bed on Asiana and others. The layout of the seats is a bit different - less privacy but more open feeling and real space. Comfy duvet and blankets provided on this night flight. Cabin crew although older (55+) were very well trained, warm, polite and efficient. They came around repeatedly talking to the passengers and making sure we were comfortable and seemed to genuinely care. In fact their efforts helped overcame the other deficiencies in the hard product. Compared to the brusque automatons on United these folks were full of smiles and eager to please. Also the Indian food selection was delicious. The negatives: compared to the premium airlines AI is clearly not as polished or well organized. Meals were provided all at once in a single tray - not course by course as on other airlines. Menus was not provided. Wine choice was very limited. Champagne was served lukewarm. After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away. Movie selection though limited was not as bad as I had imagined. It would be nice to have served a quick snack or wake-up drink prior to landing. It was strange that the only announcement we got to wake us up was the one saying we were preparing to land! Overall a good product and definitely exceeded expectations.

There is barely any concept of good professional customer service. They don’t care about customer loyalty. This is even more evident with airlines as there is very little competition in the domestic sector that is now basically a duopoly between Indigo and Air India. I have had heaps of bad experiences with Air India and had to forego many flights when they change schedule. When they change schedule and it does not suit you they refuse to provide you a refund and you lose the money. I preferred Indigo as I found the service good and had no problems until recently. I had booked return flights IXC-JDH in early July to fly in late August. A week ago on checking my bookings on their app I found they had changed my inbound flight from JDH to IXC from a layover in JAI to DEL. No issue with that. However there was no message or email from the airline of the change. I just happened to find out while going through my booking on the app. Not only that, the timing was changed from 1125 to 0925 hours. Had I not checked I would have missed my flight. As the new time was not suitable to me I called the airline. I was able to change to a later time. However I was told I must pay a change fee of INR 2000 per ticket. You change schedule and expect the customer to pay for it? I explained to the agent that this is an Involuntary change and I must not have to pay for it. The agent put me on hold to get an authorisation. I was able to amend the time without having to cough up the unreasonable charge. In such instances the agents should not require to get authorisation. They should be authorised to amend without wasting time on either end. Now after a week, I find out they have once again made a schedule change. They have now moved my flight from JDH to 1450 from 1025. I will arrive in DEL at 1625. However they have not amended my connecting flight DEL-IXC. That is scheduled at 1505, which will land in IXC before I even arrive in DEL. So I am back on the phone to Indigo. I requested them to put me on their DEL-IXC flt at 1725. Once again they are unable to do that. Was advised they will check and call me back. Got a call they are unwilling to put me on that flight. They want me to take a 5 hour layover in Delhi and arrive in IXC at 2230 instead of my original booked flight at 1500 hours. I once again pleaded my case. Was told they will check call me again. Again refused, obviously that is a peak hour flight and they would rather sell at a premium and let us helpless passengers waste time at the transit airport. No empathy at all. There is no recourse, either take it or leave it. I find this totally unacceptable and very poor service. ",Vistara,2024,8

With google algorithms I understood the Raipur Ahmedabad flight created delay for Ahmedabad Mumbai domestic. But they didn't have any other backup. This had happened several times with me & I have stopped booking Indigo for my international destinations. My father in law called up the customer care they said, ""Sir aaj flight cancelled he. Aap ghar jaiye."" (Sir today's flight has been cancelled. Please go home.) Ghar jaiye???? (I have a recording) Is this a Jantanagri express that got cancelled? He fought with the customer care guy & then they offered next day flight of Ahmedabad to Delhi to Dubai. I had to take a leave from office & travel to Dubai to pick them up. Also they didn't give any hotel or food till 11.59 pm. After 12.00 am they gave lounge access & some food. They were at airport since previous day 5 pm. Till 12.00 am nothing was given. They said your flight is scheduled next day at 4.00 am so we can't give food & lounge today. Seriously? I would recommend people around the world even if you are getting 99% off from Indigo don't travel unless time isn't money for you.

They hurt me emotionally and physically, 3 days spent at the airport just looking for a bag. I booked another flight and they told me my bag will be loaded. When I was boarding they said my bag isn’t there and no one knows where is it. They are the worst in the world. And if you’re thinking “ah they’re cheaper then others that’s ok” - it's wrong.

Tried to do so online but in vain, the online portal just returned cryptic error messages. Sent an Email to Customer Service asking for advise to change flights as its not possible online.

They have all sorts of arbitrary rules that don't affect their ability to do their job but do affect your flight experience. For example, a few times I've arrived to my flight early due to a changing work schedule in time to take their previous flight going the same way on the same day. Every time they refuse despite having plenty of space - apparently they cannot tolerate changing my flight despite the fact that it would save me 4 hours of being away from my family and cost them nothing. Today they made me check my carry on because it was 8kg and over their limit of 7kg. Why do they care if that 8kg is carried in my hand or under the plane?

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Mumbai,2017-05-01,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,"  Delhi to Mumbai on Indigo Airbus A321. Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again? Maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap, but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead.",Vistara,2017,5

The ground crew and cabin crew is well-trained and swift and helpful. The only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system. The magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in India for a vacation or a tour. The airline connects almost each and every airport of India.

They know very well that we cannot go and check in our luggage even if we want to because boarding has already started and it is less than an hour of departure. This is done intentionally to fleece the regular travellers who do not bother to check in a briefcase. Finally I had to pay 1,800/- or I had to miss the flight. ",Vistara,2024,5

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amritsar to London Heathrow via Dubai,2024-02-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," SpiceJet proved to be incredibly disappointing and untrustworthy in my recent experience. Traveling with my family, a total of six individuals, we embarked on a journey from Amritsar (ATQ), India to DXB (Dubai) on February 24, 2024. The scheduled departure time was 08:40 AM, with a connecting flight from Dubai to London Heathrow at 14:30 Hrs via Emirates. Our ticket was booked through the booking.com portal as a single ticket, rather than separate bookings to facilitate the connection. However, our experience with SpiceJet quickly turned sour. Departing from ATQ, the flight was delayed by 55 minutes. Upon arrival in Dubai, we encountered further frustration as we remained onboard the aircraft for over an hour and a half without disembarkation. Initially, we were given excuses regarding weather conditions, despite the clear and sunny day in Dubai, and optimal weather conditions for take-off. Eventually, a member of the ground staff revealed the truth - the delay was due to SpiceJet's scheduling issues and the busy nature of Dubai airport. This delay resulted in us missing our connecting flight to London Heathrow. Expecting assistance from SpiceJet, we hurried to their counter hoping for a resolution. However, to our dismay, they refused to take responsibility or provide any alternative solutions. Their staff was unhelpful and dismissive, leaving us stranded in Dubai with our children. Consequently, we were forced to purchase new tickets at a staggering cost of £4061 to secure our journey back to the UK. I feel compelled to caution others against falling victim to this airline's deceptive practices.

We booked a direct flight from Mumbai to Jaisalmer with SpiceJet in June for the Xmas holidays. Come a week before the flight SpiceJet starts smsing and emailing us that there is no direct flight and we will need to choose an alternative flight with a connection in Delhi and 10 hour layover options. At such a last minute all airfares were exorbitant and it was impossible to rebook flights even if we took refund. We wrote to them asking for a hotel stay for the layover. This was denied too. They held on to our money for 6 months before doing this. This is not where the ordeal ends. The first flight was delayed. Sat on the runway for over an hour before take off. We had to rush and change terminals. We were assured that our suitcases would reach Jaisalmer with us by every flight attendant and their airport staff. They did not. We were stranded without our winter wear and suitcases for 2 days in Jaisalmer till our suitcases were given to us the next day. We were forced to spend thousands of rupees on new clothes for the entire family. We asked them to reimburse this amount too. They did not. We asked for our choice of sandwich as per their menu. They did not have it. Do not book Spicejet flights even if you’re getting them for free.

There was a lack of clear communication about the cause of the delay and what steps were being taken to resolve the issue. Furthermore, when the flight finally did depart, it was further delayed due to additional issues with the plane.

Had to postpone my journey as my wife is pregnant and she couldn’t take a 5 hours since SpiceJet added a stop thereby routing my journey from Mumbai to Jabalpur to Chennai and making a 2 hours direct journey to a 5 hours journey. Left with no other option, I had to shift my journey date to 9th June. Reached airport and there started another another round of drama. Ill mannered, rude and arrogant ground staff at the counter made me stand for 30 mins and then she finally came up with a form which stated that if any things goes wrong with my pregnant wife’s health, the airline will not be responsible for anything including any expense incurred in health. Me, my wife and my 3 year old son- we all were allotted a different seat numbers. Even after requesting multiple time, that lady refused to give us sequential seating arrangement.

This has happened with Delhi to Jabalpur flight in January 2019 as well when they postponed the flight by 7 hours. Why would anyone book a early morning unless one has some work during the day. SpiceJet has ruined the whole program I had, morning as well as evening, not only at Jabalpur but also at my base location because I had not planned any work due to upcoming travel.

The flight was scheduled to land at Shirdi at 4.50pm. Instead, the flight landed at Mumbai at 5.30pm. Announcement was made just before landing at Mumbai. Reason given was storm at Shirdi when actually there was no storm and 3 different flights from Chennai, Tirupati and Vizag (including one ATR) landed around the same time. This was confirmed from local authority at Shirdi. Passengers were in the aircraft for more than 3 hours in Mumbai, during this period there were only 2 announcements, 1st announcement after 1 hour of landing in Mumbai that flight will be taken to Nashik as it could not land in Shirdi after dark. 2nd announcement after 3.5 hours was that passengers were given 3 options: Option 1: stay at Mumbai for the night and go to Shirdi next day. Option 2: Go to Shirdi by bus. Option 3: Go back to Delhi and fly to Shirdi next day. There was utter confusion and no clarity. Passengers lost their patience and naturally got furious. We were deboarded in Mumbai airport around 9.00pm. It took one hour to collect the checked-in luggage as different ground crew announced different conveyor belt Nos (No 1,4,14 and finally 13). Ground staff signed and put stamp on the boarding pass of the passengers after writing full refund of the to ticket charges. On requesting for refund through mail, SpiceJet authorities refuse to refund citing the reason for rescheduling of flight (mail from SpiceJet attached). This is totally misleading information and mismanagement by SpiceJet treating their customers as fools and commodity. SMS/Mail from SpiceJet was about cancellation of the flight which was not correct. The loss of time, mental stress, fatigue and poor communication and misinformation by the Pilot can not be compensated in terms of money. I had already blacklisted SpiceJet earlier because of their poor service..

We pleaded with to them but their attitude was so rude. After pleading for 20 mins they gave us boarding passes because we had already done online check in. After all this drama I finally boarded the flight 15 mins early, if they haven’t made this an issue I would have boarded half an hour earlier. I really recommend to please learn hospitality from other airlines, I also travelled with Vistara, Indigo, GoAir and Air India, if their customers are late they actually look for you and make you board the flight without making it an issue.

I never expected such care and warmth, she was very grounded and so real, not like she was doing her job.

Also to note was how they kept the washroom sanitized after every five passengers had accessed it. I personally had a very bad headache that day and they helped me overcome that by providing excellent service. They were very polite (although I know it is their job). The steward was very kind to first ask me if I had taken food before getting me a pill and lukewarm water (this matters because medicines have to be taken after food and with lukewarm water and not every flight steward/stewardess bothers to make sure if the passenger has eaten something and if the temperature of the water is right). After this, the stewardess approached me a second time to enquire if I was doing okay and if I needed something which I thought was a very sweet and generous gesture from their side and I was so satisfied and happy because I had never received that kind of treatment on any flight before. I know it is the job of an air host/hostess to attend to the passengers, but to date, on every flight I've been to, none of them have come back to enquire about my health after attending to me once.

They knew I had a UK no and Obviously anyone knows that they should have dialed 0044 before dialing my no? I checked in about 7:40 and there was plenty of time for them to inform me prior to taking off. Why didn’t they use the communication speaker sound system to call my name? I travelled all the way from the UK and Spicejet has managed to destroy my stay, why? I phoned the extremely unhelpful “helpline “some 5 times but they acted very unprofessional and were not helpful the slightest. I had all my very necessary belongings including my medicines in the luggage. There was no information anywhere re. Power bank restriction.  The check in staff could easily have either phoned me or called me through the airport speaking sound system. The Mumbai staff could have phoned the Cochin staff and informed them that my luggage was suspended in Mumbai rather than leaving me anxiously waiting for my luggage which never arrived. Spicejet staff could have been helpful and send my luggage to Cochin airport the same day. 5“Helpline” extremely Unhelpful at all times and never called me back for update. 6Finally when my luggage was sent to Cochin 3 very long and troublesome days later, my power bank was not in there.

SpiceJet, as you may know is a low budget airline, but who knew in this case that low budget means lowest quality? My family and I started our return flight back to Dubai with discomfort, for our seats were positioned directly in front of the emergency exit doors. So whilst we couldn't recline our seats, those in front of us could. Let me just say this resulted in little to no room for sitting, reading, or even for that matter sleeping. To provide a more visual description we were literally trapped in our seats, so if you get claustrophobic either pray you get a better seat or better yet I would recommend avoiding the flight itself. This dissatisfaction didn't stop there. The food which my sister and I had specifically pre ordered due to our dietary constraints (paleo) and already paid for was not available. As we couldn't eat any of the other meals available, we had to order 2-3 other meals and scrape at whatever we would be able to eat, which wasn't a lot as the portion sizes were extremely small, in comparison to the food available at the airport which we didn't consume due to the fact that our pre-ordered meals would be served on the plane. This review is specifically targeting SpiceJet's management and organization, not its cabin crew who were in fact very helpful with providing additional meal alternatives for us. It's a shame to think that these issues could have easily been avoided if my family and I had been informed of our seating locations prior to boarding.

After 2 weeks when we returned immigration office didn’t allowed us to leave the airport (connection was long – above 24 hours and Vistara not secured transit hotel). When Vistara staff was called from Immigration to offer service for customers staff of Vistara wanted to send us again to transit are promised us to arrange transit hotel, to organize meal, water etc. But procedure which used was clever, every 100-200 meters they sent us to another person, and last one – before secure control promised that up stairs will wait another Vistara representative who will help us. Upstairs was duty free area without any Vistara office/ desk. Without also possibility to return.

Once check-in was enabled we were assigned with default seats and they were not next to the bassinet so we called the customer care again to confirm. We were instructed by the customer care person to not change the default allocated seats and asked us to reach 4 hours before departure time to the airport as bassinet seats can only be assigned to parents at the airport while boarding. So we did as instructed and reached Paris airport before 4 hours departure but to our surprise all the bassinet seats were already sold out. As per ground staff there are 2 bassinets in economy out of which one bassinet is taken by a parent and other seat next to bassinet is assigned to a lady travelling alone. Ground staff assured us that they will make a request to the lady and ask her to swap the seat with one of us so we can have the bassinet for our daughter. When boarding was about to start (same ground staff present who said they will make the request) we reminded again to the staff but as per them the lady was still not there so we were again asked to go ahead and they will make a request once she will board the flight and we again trusted them. Now once we boarded the flight , the crew in flight said they can not request someone to give their seats to us and it's no longer possible to have the bassinet seat. The best thing we found in this entire scenario is that none of the bassinet seats were assigned to parents. All those seats were sold to individuals (we were lied by the ground staff saying that its given to a parent but all three person sitting were individuals and not even travelling together as a family) who paid for extra leg space so my question is why are those seats called bassinet seats at all and you even say it to parents that those seats are designed for parents travelling with kids and can be only given to the parents on first come first basis when this is not at all followed by your staff or your system anywhere? We requested multiple times from the customer care to let us choose those seats beforehand and we were even ready to pay for the charge also? Even after doing this much followup a simple thing can not be done by your staff then am not sure how you are operating this big airline. We would have happily travelled with our daughter without bassinet if those seats were given to other parents with higher needs but those seats were assigned to individuals with no kids while others were just struggling with their kids.",Vistara,2023,11

Unfortunately, the initial flight from Bangalore experienced a half-hour delay, which caused concern as I had a tight connection in Delhi to catch my Vistara flight to Kathmandu. Upon arrival in Delhi, I immediately proceeded to the International transfer office to seek assistance. Regrettably, the Vistara staff informed me that I would not be able to catch my connecting flight. They mentioned they could provide an alternative, and I suggested two possible options: Royal Nepal Airlines A330 and Air India A319/20. However, the staff working there insisted that no alternatives were available and informed me that I had to stay in Delhi for a day. When I requested accommodation, the Vistara staff provided the name of a hotel called ""Saptagiri."" Concerned about the poor reviews of this hotel on Google Maps, I asked for a better alternative. I was directed to speak with a senior staff member who wore an Air India identity card. This individual was incredibly rude and unhelpful, insisting that I had no choice but to stay at the designated hotel. His behavior was both dominating and frustrating. Upon arriving at the suggested hotel, I found it to be in a deplorable condition, far worse than expected. To my shock, the hotel owner informed me that Vistara Airways had only allocated Rs. 400 per guest for food, which was wholly inadequate. I eventually managed to return via Vistara Air on the 17th, but this entire experience has left a lasting negative impression.

Since then I have passed on all the documents and information at least 10 times to Vistara via direct email, twitter. They initially insisted we hadn't been charged the second time, but I have bank statements to prove we have then they said that we were not entitled to a refund as we took the flights, we know we did, but we paid twice for them Vistara.

Flew into Mumbai, on a long and exhausting international flight. (Those of you that make these long haul journeys know exactly how I feel) Was booked on a connecting flight to Bengaluru. The check in at Mumbai Airport started with the Business Class and Premium Economy check in counters being roped off. I had to wait to be noticed to be let in. International flights let you check in two bags with a weight allowance of fifty pounds each. International connecting travellers are given the same allowance provided their connecting flight is within forty eight hours of the initial journey for the Domestic sector. I was charged nine thousand rupees extra baggage fees for a two and and a half thousand rupee flight. I asked for the Station Manager was told there are four of them assigned but unavailable. I was not the only victim of this extra baggage fee scam, there were several other international travellers that were facing this unfair extortion. My first service experience with this Airline has been incompetent, unpleasant, unaccommodating and rude, which I was forced to pay extra for. Not something any tired long haul International traveler should have to experience, least of all pay extra for. I sincerely hope that my sharing this unfortunate experience helps you avoid it. Fair, accommodating, competent customer service, ""brand loyalty"" or ""customer retention"" is not a priority here.",Vistara,2023,8

The check-in was smooth and quick, the in-air experience was fantastic, there was a wide selection of meals and desserts on offer. The Vistara A321 is perhaps the only flight in which you can experience lie flat seats and a nice big IFE screen in domestic flights within India. The service was prompt and pleasant. Just a few things which could add to the experience - a wider selection of content would be needed for international routes, the content on offer was great for a domestic hop but thin in case the same selection is offered for an international flight. The Encalm lounge in Delhi is a improvement over the previous lounge but still not comparable to the one in Mumbai.

After their confirmation regarding the extra baggage added in the PNR, they didn't allow me to board without charge of extra luggage. It was a hot discussion at the Ahmedabad airport and they treated me with totally rude behaviour and wasted 3 hours at the airport. They don't know the meaning of humbleness and the fact came out that there is not synchronization between their team. Customer team response totally disagreed by their airport team. Since last 35 days, I'm sending chasers to them but received 2 emails that to with incomplete information and denied to give the refund. Worst experience I have ever had in my life for this flight.

Due to delays on Vistara, the flight did not land in time to make the connecting flight to Udaipur - even though we were assured on the flight over to Delhi by the staff onboard that since the delay was about 40 min, the connecting flight would wait for the 20 passengers to Udaipur. At Delhi airport, the Vistara ground staff told us that the connecting flight had departed and that they were trying to figure out what to do. We were asked to reclaim our suitcases in Delhi and told that we would be booked on an Indigo flight that was due to leave in 3 hours time. No other information was provided for almost 2 hours, and we were repeatedly told when enquiring that the ""seniors officers"", who did not appear once in front of us were working on the issue. With less than 1 hour to go, we were handed printed paper tickets on 8x11 sheets with random passenger's barcodes on both side of the sheets of paper and told to make our way to Terminal 1. We now had to pair up with random passengers and travel together so that we could go through security at the other terminal. Nobody escorted. the group of 20 to Terminal 1, which is 20+ minutes by a shuttle bus that weaves through the city traffic to Terminal 1 from Terminal 3. We got to terminal 1 with 2 minutes before they closed baggage intake. As a premium economy passenger, the baggage allowance is 30 Kg on Vistara, and we were assured by the ground staff that the baggage allowance would be honored as Vistara had called ahead to Indigo. To our surprise, Indigo told us that no such calls were placed and that we had to pay for any excess baggage above the standard 15 Kgs. We had to shell out INR 8250 (over $100) for excess baggage just so that we could get on the flight. When I called Vistara to rectify the situation, I was placed on hold for 25 min and eventually the line was cut off. On the 2nd call, after a 15 minute conversation I was told that they could not do anything for me and that I have to return to the Vistara counter where the Indigo ticket was issued to argue my case in Delhi. When I asked to speak to a ""senior"", I was told that they would reach out to me in 1 to 2 hours. The calls never came. I am thoroughly disappointed with the service. My attempts to rectify the situation with Vistara was essentially ignored.

No response was received. Airport check in staff either couldn’t or wouldn’t correct the obvious error and didn't seem care even though one person in our group had mobility issues. There response was that they were only responsible for checking in and it wasn’t their problem. So now I have to fill out paperwork to claim a refund for the seating I booked and paid for which was allocated to someone else. Also the people in row 24 were totally ignorant of normal polite inflight protocol and reclined their seats which affected the person in our group with the mobility issue. We asked them to be not recline their seats but all to no avail. Eventually after a vocal exchange with these people a flight attendant moved them to different seats.

When I landed in Singapore, I found that two wheels of my suitcase were damaged. Vistara's rep said that wear and tear would not be compensated, which I accepted. The repair man I took it to noticed a large gash on body, and said I should replace the bag. On both sectors my food quality and quantity were lacking. Outbound sector was an overnight flight at 0145hrs, Breakfast comprised of an omelette, chicken sausage, and something else. Return lunch was a bowl of curry with chicken,  vegetable and rice. A salad started the meal and a small rasmalai for dessert. Lie flat seats in a 2x2 layout in the narrow body aircraft, with little privacy. There's not much time to sleep so its not a major issue. I wasn't impressed by the crew on the outgoing flight, perhaps because of the time of day. I felt that they were trying to rush things, but the return flight was considerably better.

Unless you have money to waste or want to be treated like a freeloader don't travel on Vistara. The staff both on ground and in flight treat the passengers like they are travelling for free. There is absolutely no respect given. On top of this the operations are terrible to say the least. The gates at Heathrow were announced 15 minutes before the gates closed. Considering the size of the airport it was highly inconvenient. The flights neither take of nor land in time. Our fight was supposed to depart from Delhi airport at 15:55 as per their boarding pass. But they called us to check our baggage for something at around 1545 even though the luggage was cleared at Heathrow airport and Delhi customs. They made us wait for absolutely no reason for almost half an hour. We had to run back to the boarding gate so that we don't miss our flight.

My experience right from conversations with customer service in London until my arrival in Poona suggests that there is a serious culture problem with the airline. I tried to check in online 5 times and called customer service for assistance. It was clear that the online check in needs more sophistication so I politely asked if they would take feedback to help improve it. The response was “no one has ever had such a problem”. The tone and response smacked of apathy and lack of professionalism. I have wide ranging experience with many airlines and customer service but haven’t experienced this as far as I can remember. On the plane, the stewardesses were robotic and cold, not to mention uninformed. The flight was late taking off from London. Thinking ahead about my connecting flight I asked if we could have the customs forms. These girls did not understand what I was asking and when I explained again they said there was no such form required. Arriving in Delhi, there was no ground staff to assist many of us who had connecting flights. To top it, many us who had priority and transfer tags in our bags waited 55 minutes for our bags. There was no ground staff to help. All of us missed our connecting flight due to the bags being egregiously delayed. I arrived in Pune in 24 hours. Vistara how can you compete in today’s customer centric world with such an apathetic attitude and deplorable service. I am dreading my flight back to London. Never again will I fly Vistara.",Vistara,2022,6

In fact I was a little apprehensive as I had never heard of them before, but I should not have. My experience was made good by the generosity and kindness of the crew. Nothing was too much of a trouble. Despite the fact that they work so hard to look after so many passengers the smiles and pleasantries never stopped. My row of economy class passengers from London to Delhi (UK0018) was looked after by Rajeev and Tanya. Such genuine, polite and hard working people. She was a lovely host and probably the best airline crew I came across in a long while. ""Thank you Rajeev and Tanya"" and rest of the team. Fly with Vistara, they are the best, a very human and pleasant experience. ",Vistara,2022,6

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Katmandu to Singapore via Delhi,2022-05-01,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,0,6.0,"  When things go well with this airline, you get a value-for-money and pretty comfortable experience while getting to wherever you're going. The hard product is  pretty good (newish aircraft, and good seat options esp. on the A321neo) and the flight and cabin crew are easily among the best I've flown with so far. When things fall apart, such as technical issues, Ground Ops at DEL is unable to plan ahead or communicate effectively. Despite having the three hours the flight was delayed to start making plans and arrangements, while 2 men worked, the other 3 men at the DEL transfer desk were either folding their arms or looking concerned, refusing to answer any questions while a dozen or so pax from a severely delayed incoming flight are either rushing for their connection or were simply brushed away without being given the basic accommodation.  Customer Care is only interested in blame deflection rather than feedback, repeating statements about technical issues and safety when the feedback was not about the technical delay at all.

Happy to notice that airline has hold it's standard and imparts superior product among all Indian and many EU carriers. Service excellence, catering and safety are few important points I noticed, where Vistara really plays the ball well. On both the sectors, service was excellent and consistent as well as catering. The entire cabin crew are eager at work and does all they could to serve the best. Polite, courteous, warm-heart, smartly dressed and professional crew reflecting Indian culture! The catering is among the best. Do not miss the desserts.  A catch I noticed is AVOD should be updated with new movies and series urgently. The selection has to be more vivid, broader and up-to-date. After one flight, one can easily run out of options. While on-board product is excellent, where Vistara can really improve is ground customer service. Now for the third time, I got differing information in comparison to representatives on airport. The ground staff is divided on procedures and info. This can be make or break deal because it's not reliable.  Cabin crew should keep up the excellent work. A superior product does cost a little more but Vistara is doing it's best and she does reflect her heritage inherited from elder sister in Singapore.",Vistara,2022,4

But one staff was rude, he just didn’t want to even listen. Clearly telling me you can’t means can’t and I literally begged them and made them understood if I leave my luggage and rush to the gate I will be able to catch the flight. But it was clear that even if your staff was trying he simply wanted to be rude. I begged every staff member who were kind enough and have a logical reply to rush to the gate and leave my luggage and by 6:25 I was in the aircraft and even after me 3 more people boarded.

Having paid a little extra for premium economy I expected to give a glass of prosecco or champagne but received a small glass of water or orange. The airline tends to serve food and drink at the same time instead of drinks first but you had to ask for a second drink. Seats are comfortable. Biggest let down is they do not offer a choice of food for coeliac (gluten free). Fortunately we had contacted the airline and we took our own food but the staff on the flight did their best to find something for my wife. Ground staff don't care if your luggage has priority and on arriving at Heathrow although ours was marked priority it was one of the last ones out. Overall flight was good but waiting for luggage at Heathrow not good.,Vistara,2022,3

The app is pathetic, tried many times to change but unsuccessful, finally was able to do using laptop. Call centre is another bad experience, too long waiting time, also didn't get any confirmation mail about change from premium economy to economy, only refund was done on time. Even the aircraft was too cramped, very small leg space with respect to other Vistara aircraft, just like any LCC whereas Vistara is a full fledged carrier, my suggestion is to avoid booking their B737, their A320/321 are good.

However, when I had a distasteful experience with Indigo Airlines on my way to a Bagdogra and when the reason of my disappointment was absolutely reversed by Vistara Airlines, I had to take out time to write this review. My luggage bag's wheel went missing due to mishandling by the Indigo airline staff. I normally don't have the patience to drain my energy in fighting, Therefore, I received my luggage and left the airport. What came as a pleasant surprise was that I when I boarded my Vistara flight on my way back, carrying the same luggage bag with missing wheel, Vistara, despite taking a written note from me during checking in, of the damaged luggage bag, assumed that the luggage bag could have been damaged by them, fixed it with a new wheel. When I got my bag with the fixed wheel I knew I had to put this review to thank them. These little gestures make the world just a bit more livable.",Vistara,2021,10

Vistara was a fantastic experience, they took great care of hygiene throughout the flight and this was the first time I experienced full flat beds in domestic business class within India. Business class seats had quite big screens for IFE and the service was pretty good as well given the pandemic. Since this was the morning flight, breakfast was scrambled eggs with paratha which was quite good with a bread roll and some fruits on the side, pretty good for a 1.5 hour long flight.

Premium economy cabins are spacious and so are seats. Cabin planning is good. They secure cabin from Economy class hence it feels private and less loud. The mood light shades they use are really appealing and food is just fantastic! In fact all flights originating from India, serves fantastic food! Hands down it's the best meal I have eaten on-board a flight. While I am at it, I might add that they can be bit generous with serving portions. IFE is bit boring and it needs more variety and latest movies. All this on one side and their cabin crew on another side. They elevate the experience on to another level. Vistara's crew are very professional and warm-hearted people. I could see that they are eager to help and nothing was trouble at all. Crew on DEL-FRA sector were the best crew I have experienced in my years of travel. They take individual orders from premium eco cabin and nothing comes from trolley. The whole experience made me feel at home. They exceeded the standards that of SIA and here after it will be my preferred airline to travel!

Boarding and departure was well on time and the seat was quite comfortable and soft. The extra legroom seats were very comfortable and it was also a pleasant surprise to know that the airline have also started resuming their inflight meal services which consisted of a veg sandwich, cookies and a bottle of water. There was also the inflight entertainment Vistara World which was accessible from the devices but I didn't go through it in detail although it seemed it had a decent collection of bollywood / hollywood movies. Arrival was ahead of schedule and baggage retrieval was also very smooth. Overall I have to say that this was an excellent flight service for such a short journey, I can only imagine how much better flying on premium economy / business would be.

Without the fantastic and amazing service given by the staff and management at Vistara Airlines, I would not have been able to fly that day. I have a traumatic brain injury caused by a stroke and am extremely sensitive to noise and crowds. This is the worst airport I have ever encountered. I have flown there before so I was already feeling panicky. Luckily this time my 20 year old son accompanied me. Due to the roadworks throughout Sikkim, we had taken a private taxi early morning to reach IXB in time for our flight. We were very early so stopped at a good, quiet restaurant 15 minutes away from the airport. I took into the restaurant my BOSE sound cancelling headphones and silicone ear implants to make sure they were charged and ready for the impending chaos. We arrived at IXB 2.5 hours prior to departure. This airport has no priority security, no priority check in., no O disability facilities, NO lounge. To call it an international airport is a joke! As soon as the taxi pulled away I realised that I'ld left my headphones and silicone ear implants plus charger in the restaurant. I had a panic attack. My son sat me down in the shade where I vomited numerous times while he contacted the taxi driver and the restaurant. They had gone. My son has headphones so he gave me his but by now I was shaking and suffering Aphasia (inability to speak). He contacted Vistara staff who took me into the managers office, organised water, a calm and quiet space and informed us that they would board us last and 2 members of staff would accompany us through security. They helped my son with bag check in and boarding passes while other staff took care of me. They also helped us with items which we had left at the helicopter office. My son had an early morning flight from Delhi to Stockholm the next day. We both agreed that without the help of Vistara's amazing staff, in the worst conditions possible for my disability (IXB), he may not have made either flight as he would have been forced to take me to hospital. A big thank you to the Vistara Airline manager, who personally accompanied my son through security, and the professional staff at IXB and on board the aircraft. I first flew Vistara 1.5 years ago and have not flown another airline in India since then. This is India's best airline by far. The app works, the web site works and the level of service is far above most international airlines.",Vistara,2019,3

Neither the refund amount around 1300(which informed by customer care executive) is also not reflected in my card.

I was traveling with my elderly parents in their eighties who wanted to go to the wash room about 20 minutes after the flight took off but were not allowed. However, the flight attendants wheeled in the food trolleys and started serving food during that time when the seat belt sign was still on. Other than this issue, the staff were quite efficient and courteous. The leg room was better than other domestic airlines. The food was good and adequate and the overall experience was pleasant.

I was booked on an Economy seat and contacted on the day prior to departure with an offer to purchase Premium Economy service at INR 3,000 per seat which was a good deal. Check-in staff at both New Delhi and Mumbai airports were efficient and warm. Very engaging staff members at the dedicated counter for Premium Economy passengers. 20kg checked in baggage and airline was quite generous with cabin baggage too. Luggage was tagged as 'Priority'. Premium Economy Passengers were invited to board through a dedicated lane at both airports. The fleet is maintained new, smells good and appears clean. Cabin crew were friendly, but like most Indian flight attendants they were too pre-occupied with their checks and service formalities and the graciousness of the flight attendants of Singapore Airlines was lacking. Nevertheless, the flight attendants seemed to be far ahead of their other Indian counterparts. Leg room in Premium Economy was definitely enhanced with what appeared to be a 35"" seat pitch. No in-flight entertainment on board, yet. Their in-fight magazine indicated that wireless streaming of entertainment is scheduled to launch shortly. Ample and interesting reading material was available on board. In-flight service included warm towels and great food presented well. On arrival at both airports, it was interesting to note that all the bags that came out first had the Priority Tag on. They seem to take their Priority tag business very seriously. Vistara is an excellent product in the Regional Indian Market and they have all the makings of a Skytrax 4 to 5 Star rating.

As the others I already have are closed. Not that anyone even contacted me once to tell me something. The sheer incompetence of this airline is incredible. I will take a moment here also to speak about the flight itself: aircraft dirty, not a little dirty but dirty in a gross way, like it was cleaned the last time a few years ago. Entertainment wise, 50% of all screens in the aircraft were not working, the ones that did had headphones issues, the perfect environment to spend 9h. This was the last time that I will buy a ticket from them and I really advice everyone else to not look at a couple of dollars difference and save yourselves hours of headaches. Customer support is inexistant, they answer, they barely speak english and all that they do is open tickets that they close themselves probably to look good in statistics as none of my tickets got any answer, or at least an automatic email saying that your ticket is closed.

This felt even worse than Ryanair but they're at least cheap, also there was no entertainment on 4hr flight - security at Delhi Airport steals your vape and lighter even if you just transit but let's you pass with a custom half liter bottle with an unknown substance? I have no understanding for this behaviour at all, Security also was unfriendly and arrogant. Absurdly high fees for change of flight data if ticket not eligible for online change (360€ for 1 day later), might be like this with other carriers as well but I don't like it. Actually the only good thing I can say is that you can take 2 big suitcases while Air France, KLM, Lufthansa ... try to rip you off here and offer long distance flight fares even without any luggage which messes up the results of flight search engines.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to Chandigarh,2023-12-01,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," The Airline was on a downhill spiral since almost 16 years if not more. When the Tata's took over people had high hope for its recovery. However even after 28 months things are as bad if not worse. I avoid flying this airline and rarely do unless I have no better options. It's a big let down for a Tata company. I do not know if there is any other business in this group that is anywhere even close to as bad as Air India is now. I also feel one reason the airline cannot improve is due to the guy at the top Campbell Wilson. This guy has a lot of management experience but most is for a budget airline and he is trying to run it in that manner. Just a recent example is the reduction of baggage allowance for domestic flights to 16 kgs for Economy passengers. This guy says this is in line with the industry trend. Well I don't think so unless he is comparing with the budget airlines. Even Japan Airlines offers 2x 23 kgs on its domestic flights. So what is the difference between AI and the other budget airlines, offering the same 15 kgs. In my recent case they advanced the timing of my flight which did not suit me as it did not give me enough time to connect with my Inbound flight from Tokyo. I called and pleaded that the new timing will not suit me and therefore I wish to cancel. I was told that I can cancel but there will be no refund. I have never had issues with their Star Alliance partner airlines when they change flight timings and I get a full refund in case of cancellation. Not only Star Alliance but numerous airlines with One World and Sky Team offer a full refund if new flight timings do not suit. Obviously this is another similarity with Budget Airlines. I definitely cannot recommend this airline in it's current avatar unless there is a drastic change which I do not see happening any time soon, definitely not under a CEO who is trying to run it as a budget airline. I also understand that the airline is currently at a loss. However with poor management and bad decisions they are losing further loyalty.",Air India,2023,12
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Hyderabad via Delhi,2024-05-01,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  My recent experience with Air India on a long-haul flight from Melbourne to Hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, the journey was marred by a series of disappointments and discomforts that left me deeply dissatisfied.  The food served was not only of poor quality, but it was also presented in a manner that suggested utter disregard for basic hygiene standards. Packages were not just messy inside but also had spills all over the exterior, making the already unappetizing meals even less appealing. To add insult to injury, the taste was abysmal, and the quality of desserts was subpar, failing to meet even the most basic expectations. Moving on to the condition of the aircraft itself, the state of the toilets was deplorable. Broken toilet doors and malfunctioning facilities resulted in a pervasive stench that permeated the seating area, creating an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere for passengers. It's unacceptable to subject paying customers to such unsanitary conditions. Furthermore, the lack of inflight entertainment for a significant portion of the seats is simply inexcusable in this day and age. With technology readily available, there's no reason why passengers should be deprived of this basic amenity, especially during a lengthy 20-hour flight. Speaking of discomfort, the seating arrangements were far from satisfactory. Uncomfortable seats made the already arduous journey even more taxing, leaving passengers feeling physically strained and restless. And if the in-flight experience wasn't bad enough, the ordeal continued upon arrival at Delhi airport. The mishandling of baggage collection, with staff carelessly pulling out bags from the belt and haphazardly placing them outside, created chaos and confusion among passengers trying to locate their belongings. In conclusion, my experience with Air India was nothing short of a disaster from start to finish. The combination of poor food quality, unsanitary conditions, lack of entertainment, uncomfortable seating, and chaotic baggage handling has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with them again. It's truly disappointing to see such a renowned airline fall so far below acceptable standards, and I urge prospective passengers to think twice before considering Air India for their travels.",Air India,2024,5

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Delhi,2024-04-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,0,3.0,"  How do you feel when the pilot makes an announcement shortly after the plane has started taxiing and points out a technical problem with the air conditioning that will hopefully be solved during the flight? Well, more than uncertain. When we boarded the plane, the cabin was heated to around 35°, which remained the case for the first 1.5 hours or so of the flight.  The seatbelt indicator lights did not work either. This perceived safety problem was compounded by the overall condition of the aircraft. While the entertainment system at my wife's seat didn't work on the outward flight, it practically failed throughout the entire plane on the return flight. And that on a long-haul flight. In addition, one toilet didn't work, my seat back was in a catastrophic state and one toilet was out of order. In another, the washbasin was provisionally glued down so that it didn't fall off the wall. Do you feel comfortable and safe? A clear no. It's also cheeky: when checking in online 48 hours before departure, the seats are displayed. Our two seats offered at no extra cost were in different rows. If we wanted to sit together or enjoy a bit more legroom, we had to pay extra. Coincidentally, relatives of ours were flying from Frankfurt to Singapore the same week. Here, too, the decision was made: No more Air India. After a lengthy back and forth with Air India, we were granted around 120 euros in compensation for both passengers. With a total flight price of almost 1,800 euros, this was an outrage.",Air India,2024,4

All flights were sold as “Business Class”. The Delhi to SFO plane was old, my seat was neither comfortable and the controls did not work. The food was pathetic and to top it off the flight attendants were not in any way attentive. Requests for food or drinks were either ignored or required two or three requests and up to a fifty minute wait time. The flight attendants were either not properly trained, over worked or simply did not care about passengers. Nothing one expects to be found in “Business Class” was apparent with Air India.

Throughout the journey, I observed a significant disparity between the two sides of the plane. On one side, passengers were promptly served snacks, juice, and amenities kits, while the other side seemed to receive less attention. As a paying Business Class traveler, this inconsistency was quite evident and left me perplexed. Whenever I requested assistance from the flight attendants, their standard reply was, “We’ll take care of it for your side later.” Unfortunately, these assurances rarely translated into action. Whether it was headphones, desserts, or other amenities, the promised items often failed to materialize. Strongly urge the management to implement better checks and balances. Keeping track of items served to each passenger is essential. After all, we all paid for the same Business Class experience, and it’s disheartening to see such discrepancies.",Air India,2024,3

There were so many big issues that I am writing this review so you do not have to go through the same thing I did. Too crowded and unhygienic.  For a flight of 12 hours we did not anything to entertain because the screen for almost half of flight was not working. Flights was delayed for almost 3 hours with no transparent information and from the beginning the delay time was 20 minutes which added up to almost 3 hours. Due to delay we lost our next flight which was also via air India and the staff at Delhi airport tried every possible way to make us find our own accommodation and even asked us to lie at Indian immigration parrotting us to tell we want to visit Delhi not the real reason that we had to get out as they couldn’t provide us accommodation within the airport premises which ended up creating a discussion and kind of scene.

This has been such a common complaint from my relatives hence they warned me. I pressed the call attendant button but they would just turn off the sign. I pressed the button 4 times and on all 4 occasions they turned off the sign from their end. Frustrated I went to cabin crew area where they were just talking. I dont have any issues with them laughing and talking , it is their right. My problem is why they kept turning off the help calls? I explained that the inflight entertainment did not work. They asked me to sit. 5 mins later, a lady came and said its a common issue and the fact that the flight is around 8 hours, I could sleep during this time. I told her yes I would sleep but no one should be commanding what time I do what.

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Bangkok via Delhi,2024-01-01,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,  The airline is part of the Star Alliance but is not an airline that lives up to the normal standard. The plane was supposed to have inflight entertainment but the majority of the screens were not working. Might be a problem in one plane but as it was the same on both flights it is most probably a systematic problem. Please prepare to have your own entertainment with you. The food onboard was really bad (normally I like the kind of food served in India but this was really bad). Take something to eat with you if you are foolish enough to go by Air india. The plane was dirty and even though the space was fairly good I would warn you for the not so pleasant flight. Service was ok but the limits of all type of drinks was not good (I only drink nonalcoholic and still there was limits). My travel was delayed by almost 5 hours and that was according to the staff on the ground due to technical problems at first and then after finding an alternative plane they needed another crew as the other had to many hours. When I asked for compensation of 600 Euros (not for a full refund) they changed the delay cause to bad weather and not technical issues! ,Air India,2024,1

I was flying with 3 others that all needed special wheelchair assistance, so in order to even check-in we had to wait in line first before they would even allow them to sit in the wheelchair area. Now up to this point everything was a mild inconvenience. However the flight itself was what made sealed the deal of never flying Air India. For a direct long haul flight I cannot believe the condition of the airplane. The upholstery was dirty and falling apart held together with zip ties.

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Sydney,2024-01-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  A very bad experience. It was a 12.5 hr flight from Delhi to Sydney. Supposed to take off at 2:15pm on 13th Jan from Delhi. Firstly I reach the check in Counter at 11:45 am and stood in the queue. There are so many counters for air India but any counter is not for a particular air India flight which males is so difficult for passengers as almost every passenger is asking the staff is this line for Sydney or Dubai or London or xyz destination. Secondly there were so long queue that by the time I reached the actual counter 1hr and 15 mins have already passed by. So finally at 1pm I reached the counter and handed my passport to the staff so they can check in and initiate a baggage drop. While the staff was checking my flight details I just got an sms that my flight has been delayed by 2 hrs and will now take off at 4:30 pm instead of 2:15 pm . Then the staff had a look and told me since your flight is now delayed to 4:30pm we cannot check you in you are too early for the flight, go and rest and come back in 1 hr and we should be able to check you in. So which means I had already waster 1hr and 15 mins in the queue then the flight is delayed by 2 hrs; after that I have to wait for another 1hr then stand in line again and then check in my luggage. What a waste of time. 1hr later at roughly around 2:15 pm I went to the counter again to check and she said your check in was already open about 2 hrs ago and that the person you spoke to earlier had given wrong information. Finally I did a baggage drop and went further for a security check. After security we went and waited for boarding as now the boarding was only going to happen at 4pm I still had another 1 hr with nothing to do. I had thought I will be in flight already 2:15 they would give food but now the flight is late by 2 hrs so no food for another 2 hrs and they did not compensate us with any complimentary food at the airport either. Slowly some time passed by and at 3:45 there was another announcement that the flight is now further delayed to a 5:30 take off. This meant that there has been a 3 hr delay from the original scheduled time of take off. Then at 4:45 finally they started the boarding so finally I had some relief and thought ok no more delays now . Almost everyone was seated in the flight and at 5:15 i heard another announcement that they are waiting for 1 passe ger as they have not yet boarded the flight. 10 minutes the passenger finally came. The flight finally started a take off at 5:45 pm. After all this once the flight was in the air around 6:15 pm they made an announcement that the seat belt sign is off and they provide snacks in some time. Finally at 6:45 they provided snacks and drinks.  Also from the time I sat in the plan the TV was not working at all. I informed them and they said they are serving food so they will do a reset after they finish with the food. They started serving food at 6:45 pm and finished by 7:45 pm . I told then again about the TV and they said they will go and reset now and it would then take 20 minutes to reset and come back up. So I thought probably by 8:15 at least I should be able to watch something . Once the reset was completed and I turned on the TV but still it was not fixed. Basically I had to stay for the entire 13 hrs flight without TV. I had no option left but go to sleep. first long wait for check in ; second flight delayed by 3 hrs and third no TV",Air India,2024,1

Our luggage was lost with no support or communication from the airline. The lack of empathy and remorse in the way customers were treated is unacceptable. Seeking assistance from a supervisor resulted in extra-long wait times, only to be met with dismissive attitudes. Holding a grudge for asking for help is not the kind of service one expects. I had essential medication in my suitcase, and despite carrying only a 2-day supply in my hand luggage, the lost baggage left me in a dire situation. It's now day 3, and there's still no news on the baggage. Additionally, there's been no communication regarding a claim or compensation for the inconvenience caused. The airline changed/cancelled my flight without any prior notification, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience.  When faced with a modified flight, I had no flexibility and was forced to choose their option. Exploring alternatives was impractical due to last-minute expenses from other airlines and the urgency of an expiring visa the next day.

Honestly, I had a very pleasant experience. The check in process, baggage handling, comfort, boarding, cleanliness, ground and cabin crew, food and service were all excellent - on par with what you'd usually expect with the likes of Singapore Airlines. Crew member Pranali on MEL-DEL flight on 12 Jan was particularly kind, attentive and excellent at her job. Honestly I'd fly this airline again.

The caterer or the menu designer have to be changed immediately so that the passengers are not fed almost identical ill-prepared meals in quick succession. The toilets deteriorate rapidly as the flight progresses ending up as unusable as the flight nears the destination. Can the crew please provide enough TP for the entire flight?  Overall it was a disappointing experience but for the friendly crew that toils away despite the heavy odds against them.",Air India,2023,12

Specially “Mr. Avishek Dhar” helped me a lot by managing my luggage to make it through travel till JFK so that I have a comfortable trip with the baby. Also baggage allowance for international flight was allowed in domestic flight according to Air India policy. All in all they have done a commendable job to make me go stress free the whole trip.

Family Leisure,Business Class,New Jersey to Hyderabad via Delhi,2023-11-01,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,2.0,"  My experience with Air India was challenging due to the itinerary and service encountered during the journey. The flights had extended layovers – a 4-5 hour stopover in Delhi on the way to Hyderabad and an 11-hour stopover in Mumbai on the return journey to New Jersey. This lengthy wait was quite arduous and left a lasting impression. Regarding the in-flight service, it was satisfactory, although the food served from Mumbai to EWR lacked authenticity and didn't meet expectations. At Delhi airport, I was pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and modern infrastructure. However, there was a noticeable struggle to maintain cleanliness due to some individuals littering, which affected the overall ambiance. On the other hand, Mumbai airport was extremely crowded, and I faced challenges with uncooperative staff. Despite my long-haul flight, 11-hour stopover, and having a sick child with me, both immigration officers and Air India staff were unhelpful and showed reluctance. Their lack of empathy was evident, with one supervisor even making a disparaging comment suggesting I 'try my luck' with immigration. This was a disappointing and rude response. I strongly urge Air India's customer-facing staff to undergo training in empathy and kindness. As a business class passenger, enduring an 11-hour layover with unhelpful staff was a significant inconvenience and a negative experience. I rate my experience a 2 out of 10 specifically due to the unhelpful and rude behavior encountered with Air India staff at Mumbai airport. Such attitudes are unacceptable when dealing with customers who expect better service standards.",Air India,2023,11
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Cochin,2023-05-01,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  My Mother passed away May 21, 2023. I booked an Air India flight to travel May 21, 2023 from SFO to COK to attend her funeral. My family scheduled her funeral accordingly so I could attend the funeral. I was supposed to land in Kerala May 23rd at 0700 a.m. in plenty of time to attend her funeral the same day at 3pm. My mother’s house is just 30 minutes from the airport, and I would have plenty of time to reach home a few hours before the funeral. But unfortunately, I couldn’t attend the funeral because the Air India flight was delayed at SFO for several hours causing me to miss the layover flight to go to Kerala. I explained my emergency to everyone who were responsible, but the Air India staff didn’t care about it and rescheduled a flight that wouldn’t reach Kerala until 7pm causing me to miss my mother’s funeral. It is important in my culture and religious belief to be present for the funeral and events following. How can I ever reconcile this situation in my life in my heart? The traumatic experience I had with flying Air India and missing of my mother’s funeral is still difficult to come to terms with. It took me a long time to even write my experience in this portal. Unfortunately, this wasn’t an isolated example of poor service on this flight. On return to SFO the luggage was delayed 2.5 hours! We were given the reason for the delay as “there was no baggage workers to take the bags off the plain.” Not only was my time wasted but my transportation home was waiting for almost three hours. This is completely unacceptable. I have been a frequent international flyer for years, on many different airlines, and I was expecting a much better experience with Air India since TATA took over. Disappointedly, my experience was much worse than ever before. I was shocked to realize that Air India doesn’t have a suitable plan to deal with emergency situations like this. Air India will not be an airline of consideration for future travels because I don’t trust their reliability getting me to my destination for important life events. I feel like Air India doubled my traumatic experience, my mother passing compounded by not attending the funeral. This is a regret that I must live with for the rest of my life.",Air India,2023,5

However, the food I was very highly dissatisfied with. They started our journey with cold baba ghanouj, and cold hummus with hard bread. That as a starter no one seemed to enjoy. Out of the Asian elders did not even know what baba ghanouj was. An elder couple behind me asked them to help me with their order as they were wanted veg only. I was happy to help. For the main course, it was an option between paneer or millet steak (vegetarian). As the air hostess was coming around to take our order, she tried to convince me and my family to order the millet steak saying it’s very good. I told her I would not like that, and I wanted the paneer. After two mins she came to inform us they all are out of panner and the rest of us will get millet steak. I was seating in seat number 9; I couldn’t imagine why we paid so much more for business class; when we didn’t even have a choice what we want as a main meal. The millet steak was so disgusting. Everyone behind me and towards the back of business class was upset. Finally towards our landing, we were served frozen chat and a “veg grilled sandwich” which was in fact only bread and cold squash in it.

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to San Francisco ,2023-09-01,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,2.0," My family and I have consistently had disappointing experiences when traveling with Air India. This time, it was my parents' first trip from New Delhi to San Francisco, leaving much to be desired. I had explicitly booked extra legroom seats for my parents, as it was a gruelling 16-hour flight, and I paid for these seats when I booked the tickets. However, upon boarding the plane, my parents were assigned seats in the middle section, as the extra legroom seats they had paid for had been given to other passengers who made a last-minute payment for those seats at the airport. This was not an isolated incident. A similar situation occurred in 2022 when my husband and brother traveled from New Delhi to San Francisco. To their surprise, their extra legroom seats were also sold to other passengers during check-in. It's evident that this is not a mere mistake but a recurring issue. It's deeply concerning that Air India's ground staff and crew members seem complicit in this practice. It appears they are profiting from this by allowing passengers to book extra legroom seats online, only to resell the same seats for additional rupees to other passengers during check-in. My parents were left with no other options, and the crew members displayed extreme rudeness by suggesting that my parents deboard and resolve the issue at the check-in counter. This is a clear indication that there's a systemic problem within Air India, and this practice is tarnishing the airline's reputation. To make matters worse, I applied for a refund, but Air India never refunded the money my parents paid for these extra legroom seats. This entire experience has left us deeply disappointed and frustrated, and it raises serious questions about the integrity and customer service standards of Air India. Such practices are unethical and damaging to the airline's reputation.

To begin with, the aircraft on both journeys appeared to be in a state of disrepair. The seats were worn out, uncomfortable, and lacked proper cushioning. The tray tables were broken in several instances, making it difficult to utilize them for any purpose. The in-flight entertainment system, or lack thereof, was another major issue. On both flights, the screens were either malfunctioning or next to non-existent. My family was left with no entertainment options during the entire duration of the journey, which was particularly disheartening considering the long hours spent onboard. Moreover, the meal service on these flights was subpar. The food quality was far from satisfactory, with unappetizing taste and limited options. As a vegetarian, I found the lack of suitable choices even more disappointing.

We fought for some rest and sleep for lounge access. None was given, after much argument. Only a veg lunch voucher was given, estimated 450rp per person (there were 3 of us).

The flight was delayed from Toronto due at 1215 PM to 2330 hrs. A delay of 11 and half hours. To start with we had a harrowing time to check in with so many passengers due to the combined flight. Reason given to us was Operational Reasons. It took nearly three and half hours. Then my screen on 33 A was not working. The Steward promised magazines to read but then went missing throughout the flight. The seat was broken. The food was terrible. The dry bun in food was not edible.

We even got an invitation to online check in and did that without any note from the company that the flight is not going to depart. This is only the beginning of a story of a nightmare and irresponsibility of the Air India. The next flight was two days after and we were stuck in Delhi and they refused to cover the minimum of the hotel for two days (they only gave us refund for one night). They promised to refund the taxi back to the airport but this didn't happen as well. In the airport, they lost our new ticket and it took an hour to get it back. We spent hours to argue with the workers of the airline and it were not honest. They promised lot of things but they were tricking us with all kind of excuses that were not real (they said there isn't more ticket in an other flight, and indeed there were, they said the manager left home and indeed he was there, and so on). Bottom line - we had a lot of expenses due to Air India improper service. We paid one night hotel, the taxi to the airport, food and living expenses and of course we lost two days of work at home. We didn't even get answers to our refund mail query. We recommend to avoid any flight with Air India.  ",Air India,2023,9

No announcements or indication was given on asking about the flight. They changed the gate 3 times without informing us, I was only able to know about this because I was constantly checking the information boards, while some old passengers were not able to do it and were struggling badly. Secondly, the screens don’t work at all in the flight, even if they work the remotes don’t work, which is a big problem in flights with long routes.

The Flight AI687/07Aug BOM DEL departure was revised at 1800hrs without giving any reason to passengers. Due to the delayed departure of AI687/07Aug BOM DEL, they were rescheduled to fly on the next day after 24 hrs. Had AI staff tried and communicated with staff in Delhi, there was a possibility to be able to catch onward flight for Tokyo. But no such attempt was even tried by the staff. There were other direct flights from DEL-Tyo (ANA or JAL) on same day which could have been the next option. But no sincere attempts were made. As a result, my in-laws lost one complete day. They were then sent to hotel Sukh at Juhu. To travel to hotel it took 3 hrs taxi ride and while coming back it was 2 hrs. My in-laws started their Journey from Nashik at 6 am in morning and could only reach the hotel at 9 pm. It could have been so easily a hotel near airport. On second day (8-Aug), they were picked up at around 11:00 am and made to catch 3:30 pm flight without lunch being offered. The hotel even didn’t have basic facilities like soap availability. As a common traveler, I can easily understand that 4:00 pm flight being very important for travelers who connect to other international flights from Delhi. There should be alternative arrangements to make people catch the connecting flights. If it was known that 4:00 pm flight is going to be delayed and there is no other flight available until 6:00 pm, why efforts were not made to accommodate few passengers who have connections in earlier 3:30 pm We had to cancel all arrangements made for their pick up and re-book the car with driver from Tokyo.

Business,Economy Class,Dubai to Kochi,2023-07-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,3.0,"  Disappointing Experience. I recently traveled on Air India from Cochin to Dubai on July 12th, and returned from Dubai to Cochin on July 17th. I am writing to express my disappointment with the overall experience and share my feedback regarding the flight. When I booked my tickets, I had high expectations, considering that Tata Group had taken over Air India. However, I was disheartened to discover that the flight experience was no different from a low-budget airline, especially when compared to the services provided by airlines like Emirates or Qatar Airways. It was quite disconcerting to find that Air India, which is still considered a low-cost carrier, had higher prices compared to other budget airlines. Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention an incident that occurred during my return journey. During check-in, I had checked in baggage weighing 26.5 kg and carried a hand luggage of 7 kg. At no point during the check-in process did the counter staff inform me that there was an opportunity to accommodate an additional 4 kg of weight, which would have allowed me to make purchases from the duty-free area. Instead, I was informed just before boarding that there would be a weight check, and any excess weight would be subject to an additional charge of 50 dirhams per kilogram. This approach to charging passengers for excess weight without prior information or the chance to adjust the baggage is disheartening, especially considering the concept of making money seems to overshadow the overall passenger experience. To comply with the sudden weight restriction, I had to rush back to the duty-free area and drop the items I had purchased. I was warned by your staff that I might face deportation if I delayed the process. As a Gold member of Qatar Airways, I am familiar with the rules and consequences of deportations, so I complied without any arguments and quickly resolved the issue. This incident has left a significant impact on my perception of Indian airlines. I now question the level of service and commitment to passenger comfort offered by airlines, whether it is Air India under Tata ownership or any other Indian carrier. The flight experience itself was underwhelming, with seats resembling those found on ordinary buses, causing discomfort and subsequent back pain. Considering the recent acquisition by Tata Group, I had hoped for a significant improvement in Air India's services, but unfortunately, it seems that Air India remains unchanged. It is disheartening to witness a lack of luxury or any additional features that are commonly associated with globally recognized and exclusive airlines. This experience has left me deeply disappointed, and I feel compelled to share my concerns with you. I hope that my feedback can serve as a catalyst for necessary improvements in your services and customer experience. As a frequent traveler, I believe it is essential for airlines to prioritize passenger comfort, communication, and transparency to build a positive reputation. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I sincerely hope that Air India will take necessary steps to enhance its services in the future. ",Air India,2023,7

Upon landing in Chennai, we faced the dreaded baggage problem. Our checked-in bags seemed to have gone on their own adventure somewhere else. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, the Air India representatives finally approached us. They were polite, but there was something off about their response. I couldn't shake the feeling that they weren't entirely transparent with us. But an Air India staff member at the Chennai airport handled the situation with kindness, efficiency, and a determination to sort things out. His professionalism left a lasting impression on me.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Newark via Delhi,2023-06-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug. After avoiding Air India like a plague for years, I decided to travel with Air India. Well the first time from SFO-CCU and back wasn’t bad. However, as the years have progressed, Air India has gotten progressively worse. Yes, Air India seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of Tata. Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats). However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever! However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in.",Air India,2023,6

My new name for Air India is Air Never Again. The seats, service, cleanliness and ticketing were all terrible. We flew nine carriers on our month-long trip. None of them were close to being as bad as Air India. The discount air carriers Scoop and Batik put Air India to shame. The direct competitors Singapore, United and Cathay were so far superior that you'd have to drug me and tie to a seat to ever get me to set foot on Air India again. The plane was filthy. The seats torture devices left over from the Middle Ages. My in-seat entertainment system was broken but functional. I pointed it out so that it might be serviced on the ground and got a, ""no, one cares shrug"". The service was non-existent. The flight attendants made two appearances and then were nowhere to be found after meal and drink service. They just disappeared while leaving water in the open galley.

The entire plane smelled like public washroom. It was so disgusting. The entertainment screen was not working for me and my brother and for many more people. We informed the crew member and she assured it will be fixed soon. Two hours later when I asked them again, all they had to say was ""sorry, we tried but only technical person will be able to fix it"". The meal they served was not fresh. My brother had booked non-veg option for meal when booking tickets and he got vegetarian meal, that too, 1 hour late than others and had hair in it.

Most probably they did not have to fuel or their was an issue between pilot and ground staff as the pilot after being coerced after nearly 4 hours of no response from him announced that ground staff will speak.

So, just imagine how does it feel when you are told that you have to sit in upright position for next 14 hours. I am taking Air India off my list now, never ever travelling back in Air India again. We complained to the Air Hostess, she said, ""Yeah can't help it, I will reboot the system, there might be some technical glitch or let me find some other seat for you"" but she did not do anything.

In 14 hours of the flight only 1 time a meal was provided, there was also no warm food. Customer service is getting worse day by day. Everyone expected that since Mr. Ratan Tata took over Air India, he would make necessary steps to improve customer service, make flight tickets more reasonable and improvements in aircraft interior including TV screens in front of the seats but unfortunately nothing has improved. It is disappointing. At the airport after checking in for the international flight from Delhi to Toronto, my mother-in-law was harassed for return flight which was not booked at that time. Couple of staff members of the STAR ALLIANCE harassed her and took her boarding pass and refused to let her go to board on flight 45min before the departure of the flight to Toronto. I do not understand who gives airlines (Air India or Star Alliance) authority to ask for passengers return flight?

AI has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous. I landed in Delhi at 11pm and my plane to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3.35am. They said that it was delayed and will start at 5am. The staff made a big show of checking documents which started at 3.30am. Our documents were checked three times at least. Just to kill time and to make a show that something was being done! There was no order to the boarding! We boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane- a closed space, with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings. There’s no courtesy of keeping us in the loop. This is a broken down plane. Nothing works. For a 14 1/2 hour non-stop flight, there’s no entertainment. Honestly, at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get, alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time. We have lives and jobs to get to and there’s a reason we plan a trip.

Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries.

Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment. Air India needs to improve a lot on their quality.",Air India,2023,5

Towards the end of flight, the supervisor came and asked each passenger about their experience. On my return flight, it was the same experience, but some TV's were not working, but since the flight was empty, they adjusted the passengers in different seats if needed.

The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken. As a result, I ended up watching certain shows without sound, and the entertainment system by itself wasn't good.

We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation.

The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok.

It's a complete disgrace. It's your delay but rather than accept responsibility and make sure you act apologetic and make sure your customers are comfortable and taken care of, all I got was punished and made to sit in a dump staring at four walls with nothing to do.

To say the plane was old and should be retired is an understatement. Let me start with. TVs did not work. Reading lights did not work. The call buttons did not work. The tray tables were broken.  Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture. I do want to let you know that I did cancel my return flight to Newark and booked on another airline, and I was so thankful to be served water on multiple occasions on that flight.

The flight attendant knew that my mom's height was not tall enough to reach the above baggage area but she still rudely said to her, ""don't just stare, you have to put your bags by your own"". If you are not there to help the passengers then what you are there for? If we were able to put the bags by ourselves we would have never asked them for help.

I have eventually decided to forget this amount and have decided not to remind them about it anymore, as they have tired me out.

I felt pain after the first hour, even after I placed the neck pillow provided, it didn't help. The food was good, the toilets were clean, the stewards were not stingy on the drinks and snacks. The main reason I opted for this is because this is the only direct flight to Kochi and I thought I would be able to adjust for a 9hr flight, but I was proved wrong. The touch screen didn't work, the USB charging port and the headphone jack connector was broken. The steward was handing out landing cards to certain passengers and they should have just informed the people over the intercom to identify themselves if they needed one, I had to call out to them and then comes a volley of questions, are you a foreign national, etc.. why do they care?

Despite being in Business class, there was no decent meal available for people, who wanted to eat light and non spicy food. Seeing this, we booked a blend and one jain meal on our return flight. Shockingly, the blend food was spicy and had garlic in it and jain meal was also too spicy. The crew expressed inability to provide us any alternative, even such as fruits. The baggage in Bangalore could be collected by us after 45 minutes, despite having 'priority' tag on it. On reaching Delhi Airport on 8th November, it was worst. The flight attendant announced belt number-1 for baggage collection at the time of de-boarding. We waited for 30 minutes and then started searching from belt to belt and finally found our baggage for IA-507, was off loaded on belt number-5. Again after waiting for a long time, we were able to finally collect baggage. Both sides, the experience was terrible. Also that a lady seated on a seat ahead of us behaved in a very rowdy manner throughout the flight. Despite my telling the flight attendant, she did nothing about it.

Welcome onboard by air hostesses was like as they are obliging me by allowing to board the flight. The seat was not fully operational with Digital screen. The handle/bar swivel was not aligned properly. Retractable desk was broken and screws missing and the hinges were with ‘wet’ adhesive. It appeared that they were either just pasted or wrong adhesive was used to stick the broken hinges/ swivel.  When opened the table, I was continuous holding the glass and water bottle, as it was not balanced, they were rolling towards centre. ( No turbulence). There was no connection to plug in the ear phone and the socket was missing. (I picked up ear phone from adjoining vacant seat). International flight of 14 hrs was not provided with sanitizer, face mask, eye mask, dental kit, shaving kit except the dirty throw blanket and pillow.  The newspaper shelves/ behind the front seat were too dirty and full of garbage.  The bulkheads had so many oily spots/ finger spots that they were not cleaned since many of the past flights.  Regarding welcome drinks there was no option other than Orange/ Apple juice or aerated water/ drinks and soda drinks. 1The digital screen had only 6 (classical) and 4 (recent) movies out of which few could not be screened. The map was continuous on “Flight Data not available”. Lunch was just like ‘Rice Plate’ available in Mumbai worth Rs 20/-. The cheapest desert, dried bun, no fruits. The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.  After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.  After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.  The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.  The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality.

This is the first time we are travelling in Air India. In air India even on a £800 ticket (there were 6 of us including a 2yr old, so £4800 in total) you feel poor and wants to get out of it as soon as possible. There were not even a colour pencil to entertain a 2yr old, I shouldn’t be complaining about that, should be glad we even got a seat (not comfortable though) to sit for 8hrs. The food was heavily salted and tasted cheap.  The flights were not on time (affected the transit time, so we had to run from one flight to next) but I not as bad as I heard before, at least Tata taking over has done some good. London via Delhi is not a good idea. When you come from London you need to check out and check in your luggage at Delhi again, so that takes min 2hrs in transit time (not to mention the porters and staff at Delhi trying to scam you) and you will almost miss your next flight of the first one was late to arrive in Delhi.

Air con did not work for 45 minutes when we were waiting to take off at 40C in Delhi airport (it worked fine once we were airborne), seats did not recline properly.

The seats were completely uncomfortable. I had requested for 1 extra blanket for my back and they refused. The staff member said 1 person will get only one and the staff were using 3 blankets to sleep on the seats. Also they had curtains closed in the middle row. The staff occupied all the seats in the middle row to sleep.  How can the staff sleep in customer area. Business class facilities the staff were using. There is no difference in treatment of economy passengers and business class passengers. Its waste of money. Also one my luggage they had lost and it was international departure. When I claimed I didn’t get any compensation. They are rude and worst airline. The staff is very unprofessional. ,Air India,2022,7
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Paris via Delhi,2022-06-01,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,2.0,"  Thinking of an Air India flight with long stopover in Delhi? It was a horror show. Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there) If you book a hotel and organise a transit e-visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. (I had to argue to retrieve my bag tag, which was a good thing as I suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised). The delay meant I'd missed the last train, then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass. Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque since I was already checked in. No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray. No other airlines have this policy, and mine was summarily confiscated in Delhi ""you can't take things that fly on the aeroplane"" — seriously; that was their rationale! Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom was the only redeeming feature. Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian war zone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping embargos. French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between. So your legs pay a price in addition to your conscience.",Air India,2022,6

Nothing was done, so I just told him that I would watch a movie and let him use my screen after my movie. Midway through the flight, I was really cold, and it took me 20 minutes to call the attention of the flight attendants. The call button was not working, so I tried flashing my light from my cell phone, but nobody was minding me. Eventually, the person in the aisle seat in the same row took the initiative to inform the cabin crew to give me a blanket. Unfortunately, all blankets had already run out. The good news is that the person next to me shared his blanket with me. Also, after being served peanuts, the captain made an announcement that all passengers had to put their masks back on; however, the cabin crew was not implementing this. I have had a terrible sore throat for over a week now. I just wish Air India would take the health and comfort of the customers more seriously. In addition to this, my seat and table were not exactly very clean (see attached photos). As a Star Alliance Member, I am severely disappointed.",Air India,2022,7

Once we were able to board our flight after many difficulties this airline caused, we were disgusted. The mould lining the windows and the seats was unhygienic enough but the movies screen were cracked and unusable .. only very few worked and when they did they were extremely difficult to operate. We received 1 water over a 12 hour flight and the food they provided us with was mid. Flew with both my parents and a friend of mine and we requested seats together, well at least for my friend and I because we're nervous on planes. They were unable to do that for us and we all sat in completely different seats ... when we made a complaint and tried to switch seats they kept dismissing us.

Business,Business Class,London to Delhi,2022-06-01,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,0,1.0,"  Onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work, this also applies in Business Class. One might think its a fault so they'll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not. I have found this issue continuously. My negative review with Air India really relates to my lost luggage. There are no words to explain the misery i went through with Air India in trying to retrieve my bag. At Heathrow I was given a P.I.R (Property Regularity Report and a ""authority to claim delayed baggage"" form which i filled in. Alongside this I was told my bag would be back within 3-5 days and was given a online tracking link. In this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents, this is just one example. I wrote several emails to Air India and although i had responses none of them answered my question. All responses were exactly the same (standard) giving me different links. Furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered. After 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a Air India flight back to Heathrow. The bag never arrived. I only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days - basically my mornings were wasted This happened four times. It is only when i built up a decent relationship at Heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally. I called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered. When the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it - a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to Heathrow. I got to Heathrow (to get in to the baggage area is another story) and opened up my bag to find many things missing.  Thankfully some of the missing items were located (thanks to the gentleman at Heathrow who understood my situation) at Delhi airport. They advised they wouldn't post it and someone had to collect it. With the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items, however without the connections i would have had to travel to Delhi and no doubt would have been harassed. In my opinion Air India has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down. I have seen more negative reviews for Air India than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and don't ignore them but rather take them on board.",Air India,2022,6

Their staff members are rude and unprofessional. After flight booking I found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket, so I called customer support but its hours long wait time, then I tried US number which was picked up by a rude person who couldn't communicate in English or Hindi either, there was no resolution over the call. Before take-off safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws, cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand. Landing was very hard on touchdown. After landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt, hence we checked with Air India ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyone's luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport. The airline was managed by Indian government earlier, as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work, rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default, hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease.

I was told I can apply for a refund but when I tried, they always say we'll get back to you and no one ever does. I've been writing to them consistently for over 3 months.

First thing first was at baggage register counter was full with a lot of peoples because at the same G counter there was not just Paris flight register counter it was with Paris, New York , Toronto flight baggage counter . So there was a lot of rush it took us 2 hours to register our bags. And when we reach at counter the lady took almost 30 minutes to print our boarding passes . Then it took us 1 hours to complete the immigration process. We asked Air India employee to help us to speed up the immigration but he said we can't do anything then when we finished the security check. And ran towards our gate air India employee call us to come fast to boarding gate. We said we are coming but they did not wait for us for 5 min and can't let us in. We missed our flight. After that when i ask air India employee to help us but they were not helping us a lot.  I asked them to at least give me tickets for next flight because it was not my fault. But they said its completely your fault and we can't do anything for you. My wife was ill. she beg to your employees to at least help us in something but there was nothing from them. I asked to give us tickets for next flight but they said sir you have to pay 500€ extra for that tickets. Not a refund Not a coupon to eat something between the waiting time to get our bags. Not a single penny refunded and they are asking for 500 € We paid 500€ because we need to start our jobs. After that i asked them any help to at least a stay in hotel for waiting time but they said no we can't do anything. For me it's the first and last Air India experience. ",Air India,2022,4

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Vadodara via Delhi,2022-04-01,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  Before you call AI Customer service - grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process. You need to call AI customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service. Not even basic greetings. The rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly. Couple of times I asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual. Once you have your basic itinerary ready, they will transfer you to billing department which can take only AMEX or Visa card. They do have few other options like net banking, Indian credit cards etc. When you are ready to pay AI, representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment - 90% of the time that doesn't work. With that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours, so you keep on trying to pay. Then I put my Credit card information and my India address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened. My payment was accepted and here I am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company. Finally, after all this I had a ticket to travel. Before the flight I updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information. The website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again. BTW they don’t have separate line for TSA APPROVE either on the airport. It is one common line at Newark Airport (EWR). Finally, we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal. The air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a child's meal so unfortunately, we don't have an extra child's meal. I am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so I convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal. I had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck. The flight was Boeing 777 (OLD) plane which has no Wi-Fi. Everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working. The whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system. After that only 10% of the screens started working. Now on a 14 hour long flight you don't have Wi-Fi or screen. The people who already downloaded from home are very smart. In short, have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight. Finally, we made it to India and felt now everything will be fine, but my misery continued while coming back from Vadodara to Newark. As we reached Vadodara airport, all looks good, easy going, all documents verified and here I am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge. The rep is saying - Mam, all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours, so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass. Did he say had written boarding pass, I was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security won't let me pass. The AI rep is no mam, it happens sometimes, and they know. You please go ahead. As I reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass, the officer was looking at me as though I am an alien and had I issued a handwritten pass to myself. AI supposed to inform Airport security about this so I can have easy transition but knowing AI they didn't bother to inform the security. When I said firmly that it's between AI and Airport security finally AI security showed up and resolved the issue. ",Air India,2022,4

We reported this to the service counter for Air India in the  Delhi airport before 5pm. Approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at Delhi Airport. However, they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5. I explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldn't return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning. I even asked if I could pay to have it shipped to me in the states. She said she couldn't help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed. Then once I returned to the states there was no one working the Air India counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call. I called the Air India number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that I had to call the Delhi Service desk (the same one that wouldn’t help me when I was standing there, and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me). I told him I couldn’t afford to call Delhi and that I needed his help and he kept saying no, call the airport and then he hung up on me. We called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing. The plane was terrible, seats had no cushions and no room. None of the TVs worked and there was no WIFI ... made for a long 17hr flight. The flight crew were rude and wouldn't let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the Himalayas and I wanted to see them. When boarding Delhi to the States you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board (full xray scan and everything).

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Delhi,2022-04-01,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22. The scheduled stopover was 2.5 hours in which we had to complete immigration, check out baggage , go through customs and re-check in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to Bengaluru. There was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in Delhi. So we had roughly only about 1.5 hours to complete the above steps. Unfortunately, although we were able to finish all the required steps by 1:30 pm, which was the scheduled departure time, we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off. What followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller. We are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items. We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines. Travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited.",Air India,2022,4

No web check in from Vancouver as it is not in the drop down list.I called customer service and the poor lady could not help me much. The flight is totally basic. No inflight entertainment whatsoever. The seats are broken and dirty. No reading light or call button. Thankfully I was forewarned so I had downloaded movies for kids on their computers. I had booked seats with more leg space but despite me paying extra for this I did not get the chosen seats. This was frustrating. Nor will I get repaid for the extra fare I paid as now I dont have time to run after them. The heating system was overworking and the aircraft was boiling. When I asked staff to lower the temperature they were giving weird explanations that we are flying over north pole and temperature outside is minus 60. Finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch. The thermostat was not working. The saving grace was that most of the staff was hospitable and felt embarrassed by the poor quality aircraft themselves. They commiserated with us as they were not responsible for the poor quality provided by AI. The lady next to me helped me with my frustrated tired kids. On the whole I would not recommend this flight. New management has a huge task ahead of them.,Air India,2022,3

The seats were super uncomfortable. Most of the TVs did not work. The staff was extremely rude and did their job horribly. When I complained about the TV not working, they did nothing to help. The overhead lights and assistance buttons also did not work. When I asked for water, they told me to go to the back and get it myself. The bathrooms were disgusting. No toilet paper or hand sanitizer. Travellers were not even provided basic toiletries like toothbrushes and toothpaste even though it was a 16 hour flight.

Business,Business Class,Melbourne to Delhi,2022-03-01,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,3.0,"  I travelled in AI 309 Melbourne to New Delhi. It’s one of the most mediocre Business classes I ever travelled in. It is more like glorified Premium Economy. Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping. Inflight Entertainment: The inflight entertainment is laughable. If you are not Indian, you will have like 10 movies to chose from. TV shows have only one episode. No music to listen to. Food: Its typical Indian food be prepared for that. Service: They server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice. You will be asked for drinks twice only. Cost: it was slightly cheaper than other business class when I say slightly 1200AUD less than other flights. And I chose it, which is clearly a mistake. Will not recommend this carrier.",Air India,2022,3
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Chicago,2022-03-01,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  I have often heard of horror stories of international travel in Air India but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route. However due to a personal emergency, I had to fly Air India recently since it was the only way I could get to Chicago in time. Air India has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey. The tortuous check-in process with agents taking upto 15-20 minutes to check-in a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in Delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board. The aircraft was run-down and shabby, which was the second warning but the best part was when I reached my seat, I had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that I could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist. Of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 4-5 seats had a working IFE system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the Air India logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway, The seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests, I have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that I never have to sit in this seat again. This was not the end of it of course, the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 2.45 am, it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in check-in and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 5-6 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible. After this the crew decided to rest for 6-7 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own tea/coffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said tea/coffee in. Perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the IFE could not. Finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard. The only redeeming factor on the flight was that Air India is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight, it did not alleviate the misery in any way. The first thing I did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way I can put myself through such an experience again.",Air India,2022,3

No entertainment on the 16 hrs flight. It felt like I was in a black hole or something like that. I requested the flight attendants to turn the screen on or change the seat if the screen is broken and they responded in humiliating and disrespectful way and did nothing.

The armrest was broken as shown in the photo here. They have screen but earphones don’t work.

I have try calling AI since last three days no answer. If you try to book the flight the calls goes through immediately but if you call for any other reason no one ever picks up. I have submitted an online feedback no respond. I have sent an email no response.

Business,Business Class,San Francisco to Delhi ,2022-02-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  I had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from San Francisco to Delhi on Feb 21st. The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. The staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states “you have 2 options, you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.”  When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger, completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. I explained my situation to the united manager, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager out of her office. She stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional ie. broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C.  Anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were broken during take off and landing. Finally the plane was filthy, the entertainment non existent and the food terrible. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery.",Air India,2022,2

They don't provide pillow and blankets, they don't serve soft drinks, hard drink, tea or coffee on seat.

I arranged to pay but they asked to see the negative report of the new test. When I brought the report I was told now the change fee had increased to 4500 rupees. In desperation, I agreed but was told they would only change the flight after I brought the luggage that was checked on the earlier flight. I got my luggage and as expected the counter staff of Air India told me now the change fee had become 7000 rupees.

For every call, the Call center agent verifies the details again and then transfers the call to the ticketing team for booking, cancellations, rescheduling and refunds. But then the call gets disconnected invariably after 30 mins. I faced this same issue when I tried to reschedule my return domestic flight as my original flight was cancelled. Why can we not access the direct line to the ticketing team when are actually choosing that option while calling the call center? I think this is the biggest pain, please fix this.

Had to do so at the time of check in to ensure that the United frequent flyer was printed on the Boarding Pass. Air India should ensure that any Star Alliance number can be inserted into the booking. Check-In Almost trouble free - the staff at Toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and RT-PCR test results. Staff must be trained to insert the Frequent Flyer number from other star alliance airlines. Boarding delay and nothing but chaos! There was no separate queue for business class. The counter was surrounded by passengers and the boarding was not started at the scheduled time. Smooth flight, great Boeing 777  and great meals! However, after the first 2 hours, the toilets were not looked after and supplies were not re-stocked. Extraordinary courtesy by cabin crew, very helpful to the families with kids and senior citizens. Air India Lounge at Delhi airport with very little supplies and hardly any variety of food. Cramped space during the pandemic. I flew from Delhi to Mumbai after the 14 hour flight from Toronto to Delhi. It was another chaotic boarding with 1 person at the boarding point and a lot of interference by Air India non-flying crew members as they tried to get best seats for themselves and their family members having passes. My own business class seat was changed in favor of a Captain's daughter flying on the flight.

We were travelling from Mumbai to Goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 KM to Terminal 2. The flight was at 9 PM and we reached at the desk at 8.15 PM. The Air India Personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in. It was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal. Later I have checked with many passengers who informed me that the Airline Portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal. Finally, all the personnel to whoever I spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport, and made sure that I should not board in the flight. Another harassment started when I went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of Air India. The booking officer on other side of the glass/window was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made. I kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to Goa. He somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls. I asked him what is happening ? to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets. After five minutes I lost my patience and left the window. Secondly, their call centres are closed after 18:00 Hrs. A recorded message will be heard continuously after 18:00 HRs that you are in queue, but no one will respond from the other side nor the IVR facility will be available. I travelled with Indigo so many times but the way they help me out during the distress is commendable. In similar situation at Chandigarh airport when I reached just before 30 minutes of scheduled flight, they made sure that I boarded in the flight with my family.

Check-in and boarding were smooth. They served good food on time, however, did not serve any drinks (coffee/tea/ alcohol). It was at the back of the airlines for self-service. Cabin crews were good to help. The most disastrous incident was not working og inflight entertainment. I just can not imagine that time how to pass nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment. I would download some movies/ songs if I knew earlier. Air India does not provide inflight internet. In most of the seats, inflight entertainment system was not working. Touch screens are hardly working. On the second leg (Delhi to Kolkata), it was of approx 2hrs flight without any inflight entertainment/internet service. Also, the air conditioning was not properly working on the ground. It was very suffocating after wearing mask and face shield. Air India is one of the two domestic airlines that provide hot meals.

I had very low expectations, and Air India was as bad as I feared. The Indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible. Every aspect of this trip was subpar, and given a choice, I cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline. Here are all the ways in which they were bad: 1) Their web site is terrible, and it wouldn't accept my Lufthansa frequent flyer number, even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers. The web site also wouldn't allow me to request a special meal, and it gave absolutely no explanation for why. From some google research, I realized this might be due to covid precautions 2) I made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues. The amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of New Delhi railway station for their calls. I could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying. They supposedly entered my Lufthansa number for me, but as I could tell when I printed my boarding pass, it wasn't entered properly, and it didn't work. I had to claim my miles via Lufthansa after the flight On a separate call, the rep took my special meal request and entered it, but didn't seem to know, or didn't bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during Covid 3) My itinerary was IAD-DEL-MAA, on different B787s for each leg. I flew business class, and the product is really sub par. The seats are grimy, the upholstery was torn on one of the legs, the seat power didn't work properly. Worst of all for me, the moving maps didn't work on both IAD-DEL and DEL-IAD legs. Also, the flat bed isn't long enough for my 6'3"" height. The pillow they give is a joke. The cabin crew were nice enough, but I really didn't like the heavy/greasy Indian food I was forced to eat on some of the legs. The food on the MAA-DEL leg even gave me severe digestion problems. 4) Air India lounges were open in DEL or MAA, supposedly due to Covid, but other private lounges were operating, so it seems like Covid was just an excuse. 5) On a couple positive notes, all my flights were on time, which was a blessing, and the prices of the business class ticket was well below pre-pandemic business class levels.",Air India,2021,3

The supervisor at the Delhi Airport was being so irresponsible and later was not clearly saying anything about why I'm not eligible to travel. Then he later apologized and told me he will book one ticket for me the next day.  I stayed there from 1 am in the morning to 11 am talking to everyone in Air India asking about this issue. No one responded in a good way and even was laughing at me. The supervisors are even worse with no responsibility. They even took back my boarding pass from Delhi to Toronto to take away the proof.

How can a marriage certificate is required to get your boarding pass. Moreover we did online check in and booked our seats but on the airport they are giving us separate seats. It is not possible to sit separately from your family for a flight of 15 hours and then if you tell them to solve the issue they don’t even listen to you.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Mumbai,2019-11-01,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,3.0," Newark to Mumbai. This 16 odd flight was really as bad as it can be. (1) There were no blankets supplied in most of the economy. When asked the flight attended simply said “We are sorry we ran out. When the ground crew said they only had used blankets from prior flight we refused for your safety”. (2) the in-flight entertainment system was broken and attendants simply said: “sir this is an old aircraft so many are broken - too bad”. Many “low class” customers travel in the Middle East / India sector and don’t know how to use the system and end up breaking it”. (3) food. I traveled by Air India many times and their saving grace was always good food. But this time I noticed it was super frugal (just an entree and small piece of bread ). To understand all this I struck up a conversation with one of the attendants and learned some stunning truths. He said “ sir everyone in Air India is aware of the poor quality of aircraft, non-working in-flight entertainment systems etc. but don’t seem to care. In fact, we file a detailed report after each flight, citing customer grievances, key issues etc, but nobody that can impact the situation cares. Net, it is a leadership problem. There are no customer service metrics attached to senior operational leaders’ performance evaluations and hence the outcome, As long as India government subsidies with plum jobs, customers like me can refrain from using Air India but that will not matter at all as economic forces are not at play here, For those wondering, the fare between United Airlines and Air India for this same route was almost equal (United was actually $100 cheaper and Air China was 50% lower), so Air India does not have the proverbial price advantage. I also learnt 2 new aircraft were acquired for traveling public but later converted to Air Force One for political leaders. The older aircraft if used for fare paying public. The business model is unsustainable. In new India, will someone take notice?",Air India,2019,11

But that is a mere inconvenience in the harrowing experience that Air India considers to be an acceptable journey. After missing my connecting flight at Delhi International Airport, thanks to the inefficient airport security, and spending the night at the airport, when it was time to check-in to my new connecting flight, the Air India personnel at the counters were extremely curt, unhelpful and uncooperative about checking in my luggage that was already cleared from my previous flight. Upon boarding my next flight, I was welcomed to an unclean seat and food tray. Once I finally landed at my intended destination, Air India managed to lose one of my checked bags, which I was reconciled with after 6 days.

We chose them because they were offering the best times for both trips (but they changed them later from 8.40 in the morning to 2.40 in the middle of the night - and they do this apparently regularly). On both flights (actually all 4 flights because there is a stop over in Delhi) the online check-in was not working - as a result my family of four were spread all over the plane. In one case they booked as in row 23, but the aircraft only has 21 rows. So their IT is simply not working, everything is utmost slow (it took us 20 minutes to check in at the desk in Colombo). The aircraft from Colombo to Delhi is really old and dirty and this in combination with a non working IT, you don't believe that they really care about technical standards and safety. The entertainment system didn't work on both flights from FFM to Delhi. Every passenger needed numerous resets to get the minimum going - the minimum means a really small collection of outdated movies. I think even 15 years ago other airlines had better entertainment systems. This is clearly not acceptable. Sleeping was also difficult because we had numerious kids crying on all flights. The only positive aspect: some of the staff (not all) tried to do their best to solve the problems. So at least for us: never Air India again no matter how good their flight times are or how cheap they are. It is a shame that they are a member of the Star Alliance group.",Air India,2019,8

The staff were rude to us and the the tray table was filthy and had bits of dried up food stuck on it, when I reported this to the stuff they handed me a tissue asked me to it clean up. You could have at least cleaned up the aircraft for the passengers to use and I take this offensive because hygiene is important to me. Next when we reached Delhi we were told to collect our luggage from the luggage belt and load it on to the next flight because it was a domestic one, this was the first ever time any airline had asked us to collect our luggage when we hadn't even reached our destination. At first we weren't sure because we had flown before and this had never happened so I asked the people at the information desk for help, there wasn't anyone else there but for some apparent reason the people at the desk couldn't see me I said excuse me about three times before someone looked up from their phone and when they did they were unhelpful and they looked at me like how could I disturb them from they're phone's.

Unfortunately, it ended up being Air India. I flew from Denver to Washington on United (Code Share) and then Washington to Delhi on Air India. The flight was delayed by a couple hours.

I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi. So, I had to file a delayed baggage claim. The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn't enough staff available to help. Nobody knew what information to provide. After struggling for a couple hours, they filed a delayed baggage report and they told me I'd be receiving my bag within a couple days. After a couple of days, I called them and they told me that they didn't know where the bag was. So, I started calling them everyday. It would take me a couple hours of calling before they would pick up the phone. The phone operators never had any information about what was going on. One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore!!! I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report. But they never responded! After 10 days, I received a call from a local airport. They told me to come pick up the bag. I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home. As I had a family emergency at home, there was no way I could travel a couple hours to the airport to pick up my bag. So , I told them that I would be filing a police report for stolen bag if they didn't deliver my bag. After several hours, they called me to let me know that they are sending the bag with someone to my home. On Air India's website, it is mentioned that there is $50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours. I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation, but no one responds. I have been sending them emails every day without any luck.

Due to the short length of the runway at Mumbai airport and incompatibility of Air India, they always remove passenger baggage without ever informing them. They use a very common excuse ""bad weather"". So don't be surprised if you realize at your destination that your baggage was removed and never arrived with you. All other airlines are perfectly fine to land and take off from the Mumbai airport and you never hear any excuses from them. After realizing that you and several other passengers reached their destination without your baggage, the real fun (or frustration) begins. You will realize that Air India has only one phone number for their customer service contact which is the real deal. Average wait time to talk to a representative is over 60 min based on online search (I'm not exaggerating, in my personal experience these were the timings: 96 min, 118 min, 72 min and 130 min). Well after these wait times, you'll end up talking to the most idiotic morons on this planet who probably hate the entire human race. They no idea about anything related to Air India and no respect to listen to what you want, let alone help you. The frustration continues as these reps have no connection to the baggage department and then ask us to get a mystical ""complain number"" before they can look into our case. After calling the customer care for the fourth time, I was told that the number for US baggage department (973-242-0078). Now, I called them over 10-15 times over a period of two days and no one picks up the phone. The fun part is their voicemail box is full and not surprisingly you cannot leave any message or ever get that mystical ""complaint number"". Wrote emails to all departments of Air India including the baggage department. Still waiting for a reply. It's been three days and I'm looking for the lost baggage for me and my parents who travelled to the US and sill have no response from Air India.

Nope. 7) Had booked child meals and was never offered the option while serving.

I was traveling with my son and to make it easier instead of 2 suitcases of 23kg each I chose to carry 1 suitcase of around 28kg. While going to Paris I travelled in Emirates with same luggage allowance and had smoothest check-in. But for my return flight they did not let me check in because I had one suitcase and asked me to either make it in two bags (which  I didn’t have on Paris airport) or pay for excess. Even on requesting and telling them I have 46kg combined allowance for both tickets on same PNR but they denied stating I have to pay if I am beyond 23kg or I need to find my solutions and come back to them for checking. The air hostesses in flight were least interested in service. The headphone of my seat and my neighbours weren’t working and even after multiple requests they never even for once got time in a 9 hour flight to change our headset and thus no entertainment for us. Our flight from Paris to Delhi gets delayed. After customs and immigration the luggage drop off counter is a small crowded counter. No proper queues and Officers are the most rude people you will encounter. They at the last moment before dropping our luggage asked us to check in the liquor bought on duty free. We had to take out clothes from our bag and put bottles inside on the counter which was badly crowded and unprofessionally managed. Upon arrival in Mumbai after almost 15-18 hours and waiting for almost 40 mins for our luggage we are told that our baggage is left in Delhi and will come in the evening flight and will be delivered only after 1:00Am.

I was asked to wait outside the airport where there was no proper seating facility and waiting area available.

I’ve been living abroad for the past 6 years and travelled with Malaysian, Singapore, Thai, Cathay Pacific and Sri Lankan airlines and never faced this kind of a problem. I was so unhappy with the customer service they have provided to me and finally when i demanded that I’l lodge a complaint against the airlines they finally allowed me inside the airport. I’ve my return flight on July 9th and I’ve the same 14 hours of transit time. I’m trying to contact the customer service helpline, Delhi airport office, Hyderabad airport office to enquire about the hotel booking or lounge booking but no one is picking up the phone and its keeping on hold line for more than 40 minutes.

Their solution was to offer me to fly from Bangkok to Delhi 1 day earlier, but then I had 12 hours in transit in one of the worst airports in Asia. When I wrote back to accept their offer, I had to wait another 2 weeks, and finally the night before I was supposed to fly back, they sent me an updated itinerary.

When I reached New Delhi, I was told that they do not have any hotel but can provide me with lounge access which has beds to sleep and fresh up. I was provided with a complimentary dinner from Dilli Street restaurant inside the domestic terminal. But when I came to lounge to take rest I was told that there is communication for them to provide lounge access and we had to escalate this to a manager at New Delhi airport who in turn told me that they did not promise me any lounge access or beds. I was told to just stay at boarding gate.  This is my first time flying with Air India. When I mentioned the same with Air India agents they said that this always happens with Air India and the service is not that great with Air India. When I spoke with manager and asked them ""Shouldn't they be providing accommodation for delays from Air India and is this how you treat passengers?"" Her reply was you can interpret that in any way but I cannot help you in any way except for asking you to wait at departure gate.

Although the layout is 2-2-2, the lie-flat beds are comfortable and Air India provided a warm blanket, pyjamas and a nice amenity set. The only slight drawback was the check-in procedure (that was not flight-specific but for all AI flights) and that took about 1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting to get four lines of passengers checked in before me, although these were the 'drop-bag' check in counters.

I had my retrun flight from Delhi on April 29th 2019. When I arrived at the checking counter and presented my passport, another client with many passports just passed in front of me without any explanation. She was accompanied with what seems to be the manager. The agent ignored me completely and focused only on the new customer with many passports. I asked for explanations many times but the only answer I got is ""one second madam"". After about 10min, when finished with the ""out of nowhere"" customer, he handed me back my passport while telling me that my flight is tomorrow. The only explanation I got is that there was a technical problem with the company's server and there were not enough seats. After getting my boarding card for tomorow's flight I went to Air India's agency to demand an accommodation or any other assistance while waiting for my flight the next day. The only answer I've got is that there is nothing I can get on the spot and all I can do is to send a complaint by email to ask for compensation. If possible, avoid Air India at all cost.

When the boarding started, there were two weird vehicles attached to the stairs of the plane, which were basically for another round of security checks. It was so hard to get up in those vehicles as the stairs were steep and my mom and dad who are old, struggled badly. Male security persons were opening ladies purses and searching them so disrespectfully. When I asked what's this checking for, I was not given any answers. The body check was also done in the most disrespectful way and everyone was feeling frustrated. When we finally came onboard, none of the staff or the captain apologised for the almost 2 hrs delay.

The flight was about 80% full and other than a few very minor things I could not fault Air India. The food provided was excellent (breakfast of egg omelette with sausages, croissant, butter, jam, coffee/tee), lunch consisted of three choices (lamb, chicken, vegetarian). The chicken came with rice and vegetables with a separate side salad and desert, all of which was tasty and of good quality. On top of this there were two drink-runs and before landing they provided another sandwich. The seat was good (admittedly I forked out for an exit row which I then was happily able to have the whole row to myself), legroom good enough for a giraffe. The only very minor minus points were the not-working global map and a rather limited selection of new films. The crew was responsive and courteous and happy to assist.

I'm a multi-million miler, and I'd be hard pressed to think of a worse experience than 15 hours on Air India. Not all of it is the airline's fault--but if you connect from a domestic flight to leave from Delhi, you go through seven different ID and security checks before getting on the plane: everything from accessing the terminal to accessing the gate, each has its own separate security inspection. I'm not sure what terrible people they believe would pose a threat to an airline which needs no help falling apart. At the gate. We were delayed several hours for reasons unknown and unexplained. When we did board, there was immense disappointment. The seat cushion at my seat was clearly from a regional aircraft and did not fit the seat, It covered maybe 75% of the seat area, and the rest of me was sitting on the gap or directly on the metal seat frame. The entertainment system was non-functional. A 15 hour flight, and it was broken. But whatever, it's 4AM and we've been waiting almost four hours to leave. It's time to push back. And we're back to the gate. At least the pilot checked to see if we had fuel before taking off. Because apparently we didn't have enough. And refueling took another 40 minutes. That hardly seems like a top up because we idled the engines for too long. And now we're finally on our way. The food served was...pretty dreadful. The cabin crew did their best, but the condition of the aircraft wasn't their fault. However, the cleanliness of the aircraft was indeed their responsibility. By midflight, all but one lavatory had run out of toilet paper and paper towels. The one lavatory which hadn't run out of paper had an actual hole punched in the bottom of the toilet, and was covered in human waste as it could no longer flush. It was probably the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen, and even worse, there were no alternatives--waiting another 6 hours wouldn't end well for me. The ironic thing is that the inflight maps show the locations of famous shipwrecks as you fly over them--which serves as a reminder that there are some journeys that actually are worse than flying Air India. Change here needs to start from the top, and run through this organization like an avalanche. They'll need years of good reviews and quality results before I'd consider them again, but I don't think they'll have that luxury.",Air India,2019,2

Boarding happened on time and departure was ahead of the scheduled time which was a big plus. Once airborne on this 17 hour flight, the crew regularly looked after the passengers with food and drinks at regular intervals. At my seat the IFE was not working but it was not of any real consequence as I had planned on maximizing my sleep / rest time onboard. There were 3 hot meals provided on this sector with refreshments / dinner / breakfast provided. As there were some seats vacant I was able to slip back to those seats, stretch out and take good rest for 3-4 hours which was a huge advantage as I was feeling really fresh upon arrival which was 15 minutes ahead of schedule.

What a way to celebrate the international womens day than spend 5 hours with mom at the Delhi customs office, where we literally left close to midnight. This is after completing a 12 hour journey from Sydney on a flight with Air India. On the day that Air India was boasting about having an all women crew on all flights originating from India, My mother and I were struggling dealing with the rash, unprofessional and unethical officials at the AI office. This was my first and last experience with Air India My only reason to opt for this airline was because Air India is the only flight that was flying direct, allowing me and my pet to travel together. There were a lot things that went down that day, that showed lack to professionalism, ethics, corruption and misconduct. Firstly, my pet exporting company did not get a response from Air India till less than 24 hrs of travel , despite submitting all documentation more than a week ago . Secondly , I was waiting at the airport for least 40 mins as per the advice of the baggage team for my pets collection. After constantly nagging them for more Information, they told me to collect the cat from the cargo area without any directions provided to locate of the building. The Air India cargo group and customs office had absolutely no idea on how to deal with the import of a pet . There was a very obvious lack of training , and lack of knowledge of the process and protocol . All I saw was chaos and officials palming us off from one dept to another. Thirdly , air india mucked me around for another 2 hours before actually sending me to the right dept, all I heard throughout my discussion with them was whether I have an agent as they mostly deal with agents. I assume these are the middle men who get the job done. I told them there is no need for these as ACQS India has a well defined protocol that they should be following , to which that had absolutely no response apart from ""I should hire an agent. "" The middle men in India will follow the same process as what I did, the only difference would be some extra cash they slip in the pockets of these officials, who did not seem to want to do the job. I was also told that the server was down for maintenance that day, and the money has to be transferred online and only using the net bank of public banks such as PNB. The customs kept repeating that the Air India was not responding . However when my mom reached her threshold at 10. 30 pm and lashed out at the entire dept creating a a scene, the job was done within 15 mins. Air India was responding , the server was working and the money was collected in cash. We were given the gate pass to collect our cat and mom and I finally left the premises at 11 pm at night. This was my warm welcome back to my country. I can only imagine the loops they make foreign citizens go through. Finally, Air India has a vigilance dept, which provides a phone no. to report such misconduct and malpractices. As expected the number does not work. I do hope no one else goes through, what I went through I would not recommend anyone to use this airline after my experience.

When it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure time, the captain informed us of the delay due to some reasons. I wondered what stopped him from informing us of this earlier. They have the worst in-flight service. Most of the IFE screens are malfunctioned. Some didn't work at all. The selection of movies, shows etc. were so limited and mostly outdated. The screen resolution would remind of 90s experience. There is no organization shown by the in-flight crew. Some snippets from the plane - People would stand by their seat for an hour or so every few hours ; couple guys would stand in the pathway , chatting for 30-40 minutes. Not to mention that it created so much inconvenience for fellow passengers to go to restrooms ; group of 3-4 guys would stand by the kitchen and restrooms for couple hours and chat casually. Surprisingly, I saw couple crew members joining them as well ; Some people in their seat would never stop chatting , though it was late night. The entire thing felt like a typical Indian fish market. I had a connecting flight with Air India to Chennai. Since the SFO flight was running late, I inquired with the crew members about the connecting flight status. Some said it won't wait for us and some said it would. After we landed in Delhi an hour past the scheduled time, I ran towards the connecting flight gate. The flight was still there but I wasn't allowed to board it. I had 3 other folks who were going to Chennai. We were put in another flight that left 3.5 hours later. Of course, the drama didn't end yet. This flight was scheduled to leave at 7.55 pm IST. It was 8.15 pm and there was no announcement on the status. There were two AI staff members at the counters. After I inquired about the status , they made an announcement for the ongoing delay. We boarded the flight 45 minutes past the scheduled time. While we were getting off the plane at Chennai, one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry-on bag in the restricted overhead compartment. Most of us saw a crew member putting it there since we ran out of space. So unprofessional. My return flight from Delhi to SFO saw another hiccup. This time they delayed the flight because 7 passengers couldn't come on time due to a delay in arrival from Mumbai AI flight. Remember how I missed the domestic flight earlier and I was told that 300 passengers couldn't wait so they had to leave without us. But they could delay the international flight for a delayed domestic flight. Such theatrics could only be seen with them. This is the first in my experience. They let down us again with horrible food (no seasoning and bland). Refreshments were barely edible. I would say it was the worst food offered on an international plane. ",Air India,2019,2
Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Goa to Copenhagen via Mumbai / Delhi,2019-02-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  Me and my wife flew with Air India on the 1st February from Goa to Mumbai, Mumbai to Delhi and Delhi to Copenhagen. We left Goa almost 2 hours late after scheduled time. We were told that we wouldn't lose the connection because the plane that we were going to fly from Goa would stop in Mumbai, get new passengers and continue direct to Delhi. When we arrived to Mumbai we were surprised as they told us to go out, together with another passengers to the counter E and check in again. We already had checked in back in Goa. We were running all the way through the airport to the counter. They changed our tickets and surprise! We run back again to find out that we went back onto the same plane. We left Mumbai delayed, probably because of so many passengers running around the airport. Later, staff told us that the plane in Delhi to Copenhagen was going to wait for us because we were around 10-15 people going on the next flight. The plane to CPH was supposed to leave at 14 and we landed in Delhi at 13:35. When we came out from the plane there was an operator waiting for us to guide us fast through security checks etc. to the other plane which was waiting for us. We went all together and the surprise was that everyone boarded and we were refused. They told us that our names were deleted from the passengers list. The staff could not tell us what happened or why did it happen, claiming that it must had been in Mumbai where they thought that we won't make it on the CPH plane. We looked at the plane from departure gate, leaving the hub at 14:43. That is when the nightmare started. The staff at the gate told us that our bags haven't even arrived from Mumbai due to the fact that we were deleted on the list. We spend 8 hours at the airport trying to solve our problem. Air India staff were rude when we asked for what happened, lazy to answer our questions lacked of professionalism. From the staff from the gate (4 people), we were pushed to another group of staff, then another staff and so on. They didn't admit the mistake they have made moreover, they claimed that we were late for the plane and that's why we lost it. We were fighting with everyone trying to get the true and they were sugarcoating us all the time. We were not the only ones at the airport with similar situation to ours. They even didn't want to give us hotel to spend the night. After fighting a lot they gave us a really bad and disgusting Hotel. During all day we were with no food and no water. Additionally, our bags went missing so we had no clothes to change or any hygiene appliances with us.We had a very bad ending of our holidays because of Air India's staff incompetence.

The staff are rude and incompetant and the planes are old. Nothing was cleaned and the entertainment systems didn't work for the majority of the passengers. The food smelt so bad that it wasn't possible to eat. They overbook all flights so you are packed in like sardines. Upgrading is a waste as the planes are so old and dirty that you aren't getting anything by upgrading. You could not pay me to fly them, it was that bad! They also weigh your carry on luggage.

We were told our flight is cancelled and aircraft never even left Delhi. After hustle we we provided with very nice SriLanka Air flight leaving Male at 8:45 PM! But that time we already spent 12 hours in airport. With one stop we reached Bangalore at 3:30 AM! That made 18 hours trip from Male to Bangalore, instead of 2.

We will never fly this airline again. My husband got sick during our trip and was hospitalized. We needed to change our return flight due to this ordeal, and Air India was a horror to deal with in the midst of this terrible experience. Most international airlines waive Date Change fees when health emergencies are concerned - but Air India charges the max of $300, and ripped us off for the fare difference as well, although we were changing our flight from a peak week to a much less busy travel week. Half their customer service agents over the phone were incompetent and very rude.

Most staff didn't even say 'hello' or 'goodbye' when entering/exiting the plane. Food - Average. Hot meal was ok but the snack was a horrible cheese sandwich! In-flight entertainment - movie selection was not great. Equipment was old and on my return flight the headphone socket didn't work so I had no sound for 9 hours! Transfer - only had 1 hour on the outward journey which meant a frantic rush to transfer - Delhi airport is rather old and the staff are slow. Leg room - pretty good. Cleanliness - bad. On the return flight we flew from Birmingham (UK) to Delhi via Amritsar. We had to wait on the plane for an hour as they got the plane ready for new passengers. The standard of cleaning was terrible.

Without going into details, this was by far the worst customer service in an airlines Ive experienced. The air hostesses sit around in the back chit chatting and on their phones and don't provide service beyond the basic meals. Call buttons are mostly ignored, bathrooms are never cleaned/maintained, several tv screens/remotes were not working, no seat belts for infants, and they could care less.

This was my first time in AI business class, I was traveling at very short notice due to a family medical emergency and AI had the cheapest fare $3400 RT. My collection of experiences reaffirms why this airline which had its heyday in the 70s and 80s is now the laughing stock of the airline industry. The staff's attitude is unmotivated and their approach lacks professionalism - they kept trying to take away my food and drink when i clearly hadn't finished, and otherwise wouldn't clear items when i had finished for a while. The chief purser only stayed in the 1st class section and never came out once to introduce himself or spend any time in the biz class section. The tray table hinge was broken (both ways of the roundtrip) which meant it was pressing against my thigh and couldn't be moved front/back. And the seat controls are atrociously bad - its hard to figure out which way its actually moving and the grating jerky movements make for a poor customer experience. The meals served was mostly lukewarm or cold and the staff didn't seem to care. If this is the experience in business class, i really dread to think what the economy class must be like. Clearly the airline strategy is to compete on price, not quality of service. And the final straw is that i got an email today asking for feedback - when i provided it and try to submit i got a response (please note the spellings) ""Server Error Please Try Later Sorry for Inconvinence casued to you. Team Air-India"". This is an unbelievably poor airline that is being badly managed and run for years.

The interior looked rather deteriorated and service was shoddy. The tv was held together with masking tape, and you gotta hold it up yourself! The remote control had no buttons, basically useless, the touch screen was barely working and the remote was dirty. The chair was rough and it snagged my stocking. For each leg of my trip I had to call crew assistance once, and none came until the food was served. Only spicy food was available. Barely any crew service on the 7-hour flight, but on the 3-hour flight they offered refreshments occasionally. I got allergic contact dermatitis on my hands from the soap in the bathroom and I've only had an incident once before, from paint, so there is something very strong in their soap... so I couldn't wash my hands in flight (bags were transferred by the airline so didn't have the chance to get my own soap for the 2nd leg of the flight). Luckily, they had medicine but of course I had to go to their area for help and endure my burning hands, the crew were talking to each other that I had to say ""excuse me"", it almost felt like I was bothering them. They looked at my hands (there were no visible sores, it was just a bit red but it hurt so much) and they took their time. The 2nd leg of the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours, no proper notification and in possibly the worst airport ever. I want to sound impartial but there are really no better words. This is the first time I've flown with them and I can't recommend. I've traveled on LCC many times and not one experience was as unfortunate as this.

They didn't have accommodation so my kids and I slept on the floor! Not to mention, the crew was the least bit apologetic about the delay and were literally pushing people to make way.

I had chosen this unclean, untimely airline which serves stale food only to use the transit time to meet my friends in Delhi which did not happen due to them. By the way, I'm an Indian citizen myself. So, whereas all the other outside Airports/Airlines allow the transit travelers to go outside in case of time gaps, it's only the problem of Air India.

Air India supervisors, who had no competence, leadership, organization, or plans were found to have lied to the passengers once one of the younger employees admitted they knew all along the flight was not coming. These supervisors engaged in a 3 hour argument with these 60 or so passengers and at the end offered nothing to the passengers at all.

The meal was not too bad, but unlike other airlines, the whole thing, including dessert is served on one crowded tray. The promised choice of desserts and chocolates never appeared. This is not a deal breaker, but just a bit surprising given the number of staff and the limited number of seats in business class. I think where Air India falls down is in its décor. Even though this was a fairly new Boeing 787, it looked tattered and worn. The colors, light tan and sad red, give it a dingy look.

Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Goa via Delhi,2017-10-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,0,1.0,"  Frankfurt to Goa via Delhi. My wife and I booked a flight from Munich to Goa via Frankfurt and Delhi in Business Class, then after some days from Goa to Kathmandu via Mumbai and the return from Kathmandu to Munich. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt was operated by Lufthansa, the other flights were operated by Air India. The booking was in one ticket. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt with Lufthansa was nice. When it was time for boarding in Frankfurt, Air India could not open the ticket. After a lengthy discussion we were finally allowed to board the aircraft (without boarding passes), which already had some 45 minutes delay due to our issue. Our seats that we reserved months ago were given to other passengers so we had separate seats. The business class seat actually is okay and so was the onboard service. The seat just looked dirty and used. Air India uses a new 787 on this route but they look like old 767 that have been in service for the past 20 years. After all, we were just too frustrated to enjoy them. Once in Delhi, an agent picked us up and escorted us to the gate for our connecting flight which we boarded without a boarding pass. While the Air India representatives in Frankfurt organized that we arrive at our destination, they did not think about our Air India flight from Goa to Kathmandu. Long story short: The agents in Goa could not find the ticket and we booked a new flight to Mumbai in Economy Class. The agents in Mumbai could see the ticket but since we did not use the portion from Goa to Mumbai the ticket was now invalid…and we bought another Ticket from Mumbai to Kathmandu. (By now the ticket was refunded and we received a compensation. But that was a long way.) Verdict: I had quite a few other flights with Air India last year and there is always something that does not work. It is part of the adventure of travelling to India I guess, but in the future I will try to avoid Air India. It is just not a good airline.",Air India,2017,10

After taking off from Washington, D.C. lunch was served around 12:30 P.M. After lunch the dinner was served around 9:30 P.M. almost after 9 hours. In these 9 hours there was no food service at all. They did not care to offer even a light snack or a sandwich. for nine hours and this was in the Business Class, we do not know what they did in the Economy Class. When asked the staff about this, we were told that they are suppose to serve only two meals in such a long flight. We can understand you serve two major meals but how about some snacks etc. in nine hours. It would have been fine but since I am a diabetic and need to eat some thing on regular intervals. But sorry that is the only food service they offer. Wanted to talk to the Supervisor about it and was told the supervisor would come to talk to you but of course nobody came to talk to us at all until we landed in New Delhi as if you simply do not care and if you are diabetic then it is your problem. We have flown in Business Class on so many different airlines around the world and have never experienced such a poor food service. Have you ever compared your business class service with other airlines? How can you compete with them with this kind of service? They serve food, drinks and snacks throughout the flight in Business Class without even asking. No wonder Air India is losing money. Who would like to pay this kind of money for Business Class and get this kind of service. It is surprising, at one time Air India was known for it's food service. We were totally dissatisfied.",Air India,2018,4

I had a truly unforgettable experience with Air India - in its worst kind. In fact, two awful transit experiences in New Delhi from Kathmandu en route to Colombo and return. Both initial departure flights on separate days were delayed, conveniently resulting in my unexpected ""royal"" transit treatment in New Delhi! On my way to Colombo, the Delhi transit desk staff blankly told us that we had missed our connecting flight and simply would not board me on the next Sri Lankan Air with the excuse that this was a split ticket. Instead a staff member gave me a few numbers to call for the issuance of a new boarding pass. Eventually advising me it's best to purchase a new ticket as I was pressed for time. He even handed me a 'delay certificate' (w annotation at the bottom ""We thank you for flying Air India and wish you a happy journey) that could be used as proof in the event I would like to be reimbursed for the new ticket purchased! Ultimately, I was stuck at the Delhi transit desk for 5+ hours (along with other angry customers), even after paying out of my pocket for a new connecting ticket as I was made to endlessly for the issuance of a new boarding pass.

It’s a direct flight from Delhi to Sydney - how can the luggage go missing? There was a long wait at Sydney airport to for the passengers to lodge the complaint.

I flew back from Delhi on flight AI0111 at 14:00 on Thursday 10/5/2018. The flight attendant that was serving the right hand side of the economy row facing the plane was a mere piece of cattle that was being forced to work against her will, well at least that’s the impression that me and my family members got along with others on that section. My sister was given a seat with no onboard entertainment for a flight that lasted approximately 8 hours. She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row “be careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replace”. Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break. These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome. A demand for change of seats was declined too. The concept of customer service is a mere myth to this establishment. If you value your custom and value for money my strong recommendation is seek alternative airlines and stay away from this airline. I regret flying with Air India and will never do so in the future.

Webcheck in has absolutely no meaning, in fact the queue for bag drop off is probably more than the normal. Takes nothing less than 1.5 hr before you reach the counter and the chances are you may be asked to go to another counter and then come back - happened to 2-3 people right in front of me. At least 8-10 entertainment systems are broken in the flight and the attendants don’t care or do anything other than saying sorry sir this seat entertainment is broken. Despite being an Indian airline the food they serve is so horrible - it’s just unbelievable. So many other international airlines serve 10x better food. Staff courtesy - Ask them for a cup of coffee / tea and look at their displeased expressions.

Only thing which bothered me was absence of smile and courtesy on Cabin crew.  I understand the job is quite demanding but a little smile, thank you, please etc. can bring a lot of change.

The IFE may not been as vast containing 42738 odd movies like some other airlines but it was adequate enough during the trip and I even managed to watch a couple of movies but was unable to sleep due to infants crying continously and parents unable to pacify their babies but I was still able to rest for 2 hours or so and arrival into Delhi was on time. The remaining leg from DEL to BOM was on the star alliance Boeing 777 which was cool and a hot snack was offered on this route. Landing was on time and baggage was delivered smoothly on the carousel.

The stewardess working on the flight made an incredulous expression when I pointed this out. I ended up changing seats to another two seats. All of them appeared to have problems with the inflight entertainment systems. Some did not have the touchscreen working. Others did not have their remote working and others had to be repeatedly restarted before they were usable. The flight attendants did not seem too concerned about this problem. I had similar problems on the flight back. Many of the passengers on both flights appeared to have inflight entertainment systems which were non functional or dysfunctional and the Air India entertainment system in general appears to be by far the most user unfriendly system I have ever encountered of any airline. This represents a major inconvenience on lung haul flights which are up to 15 hours in length. The Boeing 777s of Air India do not seem to be well maintained at all.

Check in at Delhi was a bit frustrating because their software were having troubles. So had to wait a bit longer in line. But finally I was directed towards the gate. The plane was prepped in time. While boarding the plane, I was recording video, but a flight attendant by the door of the aircraft gave objection to it. His behaviour was rude. He took my hand and told to delete that video in front of him. I was a bit shocked at his rude behaviour. But I did as he asked. He told me that it is against their policy to record video which I was not aware of. Still, I apologised. Nevertheless, the plane was amazing. The economy window seat which I got had plenty of leg room and great seat incline and massage options. Most importantly, the infotainment system of the aircraft was amazing. I enjoyed that a lot. The plane took of on time. After 40 mins, meal was served. Food was rice, chicken, vegetables, salad, bun with butter along with ingredients to make tea/coffee by yourself. After a 2 hr flight, the plane landed smoothly Then the connecting flight from Kolkata to Dhaka was in an Airbus A319. That aircraft was delayed by 20 mins. The plane had a bit tight legroom.

(Similar to business class seats of other domestic Indian airlines). When I sat on my seat I felt like I had upgraded my ticket to business class at no extra cost). Each passenger was served a fresh and excellent meal at no extra cost (unlike super over charged stale sandwiches from the other domestic airlines). I am a foodie so trust me the food was amazing. They even served coffee and tea to everyone at no extra charge (I pay 160 Rs to 200 Rs for one coffee with other domestic airlines). The ambience of airplanes reflects the Indian culture.

The seat cushions had all of the comfort sat out of them, there were quite a few overhead lights which did not work and both mine and my companions headset sockets were faulty. This time, the crew were a little bit better but only very marginally so. We were given a reasonable lunch meal soon after take off, the cabin crew came round once during the nearly 10 hour flight with water and our pre early evening landing snack of a roll was so cold as to be almost frozen. During the flight our ""seat belt"" lights came on a few times due to turbulence but this did not disturb the crew who stayed inside their curtained off galley areas and never came out to check that everyone had buckled up. When we were landing, no one came around to check that seat backs were in the upright position (and therefore many were not) nor to check that people had buckled in. The cabin crew member who was a few feet away from me and in charge of an emergency exit, closed his eyes and went to sleep for about 20 minutes whilst we were landing. I suspect he was assuming that if we crashed on landing, the jolt would wake him up ! Does anyone in Air India care about the poor performance of their economy class cabin crew? I imagine not because otherwise these reviews would not be published.",Air India,2018,1

The staff were dreadful, when pressing the staff requirement button no-one came, you had to actually go to the back of the plane and interrupt their mothers meeting to which they were extreamly rude about. They also made facial expressions and hand gestures about people on the plane. When they came round with drinks and food there wasnt a single person who didn't recieve nasty looks or sarcastic comments. The screen on my first flight was broken therefore I had no entertainment for the first flight, and on the second flight my partners remote didn't work on his screen.

Air India receives very few positive reviews and very many negative reviews - unfortunately this review is one of the latter ones. Our plane was quite new, possibly less than half full so we had plenty of room to stretch out, change seats etc. We took off on time and landed only a few minutes late due to stacking over Delhi. Eventually the inflight entertainment system worked after a couple of reboots although I would have to say that the choice of films was one of the poorest I have encountered on modern planes. So what was wrong? What seems to be the usual I am afraid with Air India - the flight staff who did only the very barest minimum during the flight and hid away the rest of the time doing nothing other than talking to each other. We were served a non alcoholic drink shortly after take off immediately followed by breakfast. Some people later had their trays collected, others did not. Five hours later the crew appeared again, served a non alcoholic drink and dinner (mine was barely warm and had to be rejected). Trays were collected and that was all we ever saw of them. If you wanted any in-flight water you had to go and search it out because no one ever came around the cabin offering anything. There were no inflight announcements about journey duration, route, weather, delay on landing. Four airlines fly London Delhi direct (BA, Jet, Virgin and Air India). I have flown with them all and whilst the Air India plane was the most comfortable and its day time flight timings the most convenient, the service was the worst.

Being the largest Indian airline you would expect them to be hospitable, instead they are just the opposite. The staff actually laughed at my face today on a request made by me. I would suggest everyone to take any airline but this one. It’s only negative vibes and your entire travel experience is ruined.It’s only negative vibes ",Air India,2018,1

They lost my bags at the Mumbai Airport, which is another terribly run organization and should be avoided at all costs. My bags have now been missing over 72 hours. They open a case through their Airport baggage organization, which is contracted to help Air India with lost baggage claims. It also allows Air India to evade responsibility and accountability. If you try to contact Air India customer service to discuss compensation / details of your lost bag, they tell you they can't help. They direct you to Bangkok. Bangkok gives you the Air India policy and tells you it's completely non-negotiable. They say they don't have the power to do anything, any changes must be done by Air India, and they direct you to call Air India. This allows Air India to completely evade any negotiation or accountability. So far as a business class passenger with no bags for 72 hours+ I've been given a paltry 50 pounds, about 65 USD at the time of posting. Should be enough to buy a decent pair of pants. If this company wants to call itself a premier airline, they need to go back to elementary school for customer service. I've heard that the Mumbai airport which they base out of has a huge issue with lost baggage. Save yourself the nightmare of losing your bags overseas. Avoid this joke of an airline.

However on the return flight, I was not given my confirmed seat of 18D and instead was placed in a middle seat 30J. I explained that I need to get up frequently, but I was told that the ground crew made the change. The entertainment system did not work. Flight attendant came by and made one attempt to fix it by pushing the same buttons I had been pushing. Most importantly, they did not have my Gluten Free meal. I was told that it needed to be ordered ahead of time. I showed my eticket that said Gluten Free confirmed. The Flight attendant then brought me a meal that was not marked Gluten Free. She assured me it was ok, but could not tell me all the ingredients. I explained that if I ate something with gluten I would be very sick. She did try her best, and brought me fruit, but I was not able to eat a proper meal for the duration of the flight.",Air India,2017,12

Aircraft was not as clean, seats were dirty and some of the armrests quite loose. Cabin crew attitude and their behaviour with passengers  leaves much to be desired. On three occasions they served drinks or food coming from behind rather from front, no eye contact, no smile, nothing. In the first serving they gave options of non-veg/veg/continental food but in the second serving only option was Indian food which was too spicy to be eaten by a person living in Europe. I went to the galley area to have some water/juice and had a small conversation with the crew, while I was standing they remain seated on their seats without showing simple courtesy of leaving their seat, stand up and have conversation, galley area lights were too dim to see anything and on one occasion I found all lights switched off (total darkness). They did not bother to check toilets, if there are toilet seat covers, tissue papers are available or not. Simply said, I don’t care attitude runs in their blood. If ever I will fly with them again is just because this is the only direct flight from Madrid to Delhi using a Boeing 787 and with a meal or two in my bag.",Air India,2017,12

Thankfully another member of staff acknowledged my business class status and allowed me to board first. Due to technical reasons the flight was delayed by 45 minutes after boarding was completed. Staff were really nice looked after the people in business class and offered drinks and food. After take off, food was served and the food was really tasty. Only thing that bothered me was that Air India doesn't serve alcohol in the domestic sector. Layover in Delhi was good and efficient, and soon we were ready for take off. Crew took our meal choices and preferred drinks after take of. This sector they had alcohol. Decided to skip the late night dinner and just had a glass of champagne and got a nice sleep of 4 hours.

I always had a good opinion about Air India international flights in-spite of several inputs from family and friends not to fly Air India, however I experienced this during my recent travel. The crew were extremely impolite and not hospitable. They refused to serve non-veg when asked for. They asked me to weigh the baggage at a counter and at that point of time it was well within the baggage allowance, however at the point of check in the baggage showed an excess and I was charged a $100 dollars unnecessarily as penalty. To double check this I weighed the baggage as soon as I got home and found it was just 0.5 kg in excess. The entertainment unit is the only source of entertainment on a long flight however in spite of repeated requests to the crew of a dysfunctional monitor nobody bothered to rectify it.

The ability to play around with the window dimmer is amazing. Unfortunately though the cabin crew keeps the cabin dark all the time, even though it’s a day flight.

I took the morning flight when I flew to Osaka and noon flight when I returned. The breakfast was terrible, but the lunch on the return flight was quite good, a bit beyond my expectation. The cabin crew delivered the worst service I have ever experienced. No smile on their face, when I stop one of them for a cup of tea, they look annoyed and not willing to do so. Waste and garbage on all desks as the crew didn't care to collect them when they saw them. I actually brought my own tray of finished food to the crew and saw them sitting chatting. No one checked your seatbelt, no one came round to make sure your seat was upright when the plane took off and landed.

No WiFi service on board. In-flight entertainment was limited. I'm a gold level flier and this was my worst flight experience. I reclined my seat and it failed to return to a seated position about 5 hours into a flight. After messing with the seat for 15 minutes, the flight attendant put me in another seat - only to find out that that seat did not recline at all. 15 minutes later, a discussion with the purser, I was switched with another passenger and found his dirty socks in my seat. In that seat, the entertainment system failed to work. This was a 15 hour flight that I flew business class and paid over $4000 for a ticket on. I would have rather traveled premium economy on United. The experience would have been much better.

Currently reeling under the situation of being sold off privately, the airline seems to be in splits as far as operations go. And my dissatisfaction started right from the check in kiosk itself, with the representative not from AI, but from a contract with the DIAL corp. The attitude this representative was showing unnecessarily was very upsetting. Boarded the flight with a half-hearted Namaskar from the flight attendant, something I was not expecting as AI FA's used to be the pride of the airline and a great first impression with their onboard greetings. This half hearted attitude stayed throughout the entire crew faculty present onboard the flight. No proper training given either; the methods used by the FA's to receive and give drinks was extremely clumsy as well as the attitude with which flight information was given. Food was also mediocre, not so special, but appreciated. No complaints from the flight timing, took off and landed before time! The aircraft however was extremely old, no personal IFE screen and the seats were not as comfy, not to mention dirty. While deboarding, the attitude of get-off-the-plane-already was present. Completely ruined even the last impression of the flight. Overall I do not encourage travellers to board AI, they don't seem to take customer reviews and feedback seriously to improve service. Price wise flight was great though and timing was efficient, being one of the first flights to leave the capital for KTM. Mind you, I've travelled with AI before too and was not pleased those times either!",Air India,2017,10

The positives - there was good leg room on the seats, the flights departed on time. However the rest I'm afraid then went downhill. The cabins were grubby, I had to ask numerous times for a cloth to wipe my area and screen as there were finger marks of old food still on the screen. We felt that the crews on all the legs were all quite surly and really did not want to be there and anything was a bit too much of a bother. Once the meal service was done they all huddled in the galley and sat and read. On the transit at Delhi the ground staff were not much better at the customer service experience either, we were met with rude agents barking orders where to go as we had not heard an announcement due to having queued in security for an hour. All in all, not a good experience when compared with the other airlines we have flown with- Emirates, Singapore, Malaysia, Etihad and whilst they may be cheaper it may certainly be true that you get what you pay for but for us - never again.",Air India,2017,9

As I opted for the veg option, the lunch consisted of paneer kofta with rice and vegetables with a bun, salad and kheer for dessert. The meal was quite tasty and filling which was good. Afterwards, the IFE kept me occupied for most part of the flight. The IFE was not expansive but for a 9 hour journey managed to keep me occupied. The crew dimmed the windows after lunch to make passengers get some sleep. Before landing, supper was provided which consisted of a samosa, veg cutlet and panner tikka with a bun, fruits and gulab jamun for dessert. Arrival in Mumbai was delayed by 35 mins.

That was exactly my experience - inconsistent. Not sure what to expect. DEL-BKK: Boeing 787, ample leg space, acceptable IFE, acceptable inflight service, helping and offering of drinks. Flight stewards did their job, all boxes ticked, nothing to complain-nothing to write home about. All these compared to the price I paid- good value for money BKK-DEL: Morning flight, same equipment, same IFE. But the only variable factor, in flight service, fell like nine pins. Type of meal I prefer finished by the time it came to me, since this is a morning flight, they were not serving drinks (never seen that before). When requested, got snubbed down badly by flight steward. Overall verdict: good for price sensitive travelers but don't expect much from service standpoint.

I have a large family and the cabin crew were unhelpful to say the least. The food (curry) is unsuitable for small children and they did not have a children's menu (apparently this is available but you need to request in advance, something which we were not told at the time of booking despite entering the ages of the children). Even if those are their rules, the cabin staff could have tried to help (eg with extra bread or a snack) rather than leave small children on a 10 hour flight with no food. The staff were clearly not accustomed to dealing with children and were constantly complaining when they dropped stuff (blankets, wrapping) on the floor (as kids do). One passenger had to tell them to stop scolding his 2 year old as that was his job not theirs (the kid was very well behaved). The flight from Delhi to Madrid was almost 10 hours and the staff basically served food, cleared up and then did nothing until about 90 minutes before landing when they served a very small snack. Anyone who needed anything had to go look for it themselves. On the flight to Delhi I left my Kindle ebook in the seat pocket. Given we were in the last row I fully expected the cabin staff to recover it when they checked the plane on landing. However, 4 weeks on I still don't know. The email for lost luggage doesnt work so I had to contact the airline and was given 2 alternatives. I have since sent a number of reminders but have had no response (the emails have been read).

Since advertising the Boeing 787 as their flagship plane I was looking forward to flying the aircraft for the first time. However to my surprise it was probably one of the dirtiest aircraft I have been on. Airvents had so much dust accumulated that the vents had turned black. Broken trays.  In my experience the airline had good punctuality in this flight however I would be cautious if booking with them to check for delay patterns. Staff are somewhat helpful however not very welcoming or engaging. Felt they were really there just to dish out the food. Did not get a single response from any stewardess on the aircraft on all occasions of travel when using the assistance button in seat. Inflight entertaintment is probably one of the worst. If you are flying I would suggest downlading your favourite shows or movies beforehand. USB charger ports were not working in my friends seat, so he had to use mine, while my entertainment screen buttons were broken (physically broken). Overall I would not fly with Air India again unless I have no other option.

The flight crew on this flight were quite polite and professional. Even though the departure time was 1pm, we had left around 1.15 or so. After departure, lunch service had commenced and as this was a domestic flight, Air India serves only vegetarian options and so had a meal of paneer masala and rice with dal. For dessert a sweet dish of barfi was provided. The food was excellent. After lunch, tea was served.

Business Class toilet ran out of tissue and no one bothered to refill it. It was empty throughout the flight. Again this is simply outrageous. My entertainment system did not work at first. I reported this to one of the attendants and he restarted and it seemed to work. But in the end, the Flight Map was still broken. There were no meal menu given to us during this trip. The meals were verbally communicated to us. I paid $US2,000 only to be told what is in my meals. I had two small meals during this flight and each time I completed my meal the tray was not picked up in a timely fashion. I think I must have waited 25 minutes after I finished my meal, for the tray to be picked up. The flight attendants did not walk down the aisle as often as I think they should. Service was not a top priority for this set of crew. Meals were warm although I've had better economy international food than Air India's business class.

The departure time of the flight was 13:15 however the flight departed after a delay of 45 mins. The inflight service was top notch. After an hour or so, flight attendants served drinks (eg. orange juice, water, whiskey) and peanuts. I opted for the non veg option for lunch which was lamb curry with rice along with salad, a bun and kheer for dessert. The food was excellent. The IFE entertainment had a good collection of movies (Hollywood/ Bollywood) and TV shows. Before landing, a second hot meal service where for non veg, malai chicken along with veg hara bhara kebab and pattice was given along with a bun, fruits and a gulab jamun for dessert.

Upon waking up, a second round of food and drinks service started and watched a Hollywood movie. The non veg option contained chicken and rajma with rice, salad and gulab jamun.

I am already on my way to airport, i was informed that the flight got cancelled due to technical issues and should postpone my visit to next day. It was important for me to fly on the same day and hence asked them to make necessary arrangements. I was routed to NY airport and was told that I will be issued a new itinerary from NY to DEL. Once reached the NY airport, was asked to find a connection flight on my own from DEL. I had to put up an hour's argument to prove my point that its a last minute cancellation and would be difficult for me to rebook a flight from Delhi and it being after 7PM will be even more difficult to find any local flights. Now, I am not sure if i can take the risk of flying back in Air India as the last minute cancellations seems to be pretty common for them and asked them to cancel the return trip and process the refund. its been 7 days since i made multiple calls and haven't heard from them yet.

Boarded the plane and we sat there with the In-Flight Entertainment not working for an hour and a half. We had to remind the flight attendant to turn it on. The screen though is massive, and there is a wide variety of movies in HD in English and Indian. This is probably because of their new 787 Dreamliner which is very nice. The seats recline a lot and the windows are all tinted blue the whole flight so the plane isn't to bright. We got served a Indian lamb or chicken dish. Very authentic Indian food along with very nice Indian flight attendants. IFE stayed on the whole flight and they server a breakfast of chicken and falafel which was very good.

Couple Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to Chicago,2017-02-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,2.0,"  I have no complaint about the service we received on our flight other than the entertainment system was somewhat hard to use and that my husband could find no classical music which he usually enjoys listening to on long haul flights. My complaint is about the ground personnel for Air India in Delhi. Due to a mechanical problem on our flight from Kolkata we missed our connection to a Lufthansa flight in Delhi. Lufthansa could not help us book a new flight and told us that Air India had to do it. When we finally made our way to the Air India booking desk there was a mob at the desk, not an organized queue. Would it be too much to put up some ropes so that people could queue and be helped in an orderly manner? When we finally got the attention of a person at the desk she said we had to contact Lufthansa in order to rebook which was the opposite of what Lufthansa told us. She gave us a voucher for a hotel and told us to contact Lufthansa in the morning. It was now 5 am. The hotel was horrible. It looked to be still under construction. It was cold and in a noisy neighborhood. The breakfast was awful. We could not reach Lufthansa with the phone numbers that Air India had given us the night before so we had to head back to the airport after getting less than three hours of sleep. This time there was no mob in front of the Air India booking desk but the man who helped us was interrupted 10 times while serving us. He told us he needed a ticket number to rebook the flight. Why didn't the Air India woman the previous night tell us this? After we provided him with that number it took him 2 hours to make the new booking. Then we had 13 hours to wait for our flight with no comfortable place to wait since we were told we could not access the Business Class Lounge until 4 hours before our flight. When we were finally allowed to check in for the flight the personnel at the Air India Business Class desk could only be described as surly. I find it difficult to believe that Air India truly wants its employees to treat passengers especially those who have paid a premium to fly in business class to be treated so poorly.",Air India,2017,2

We booked Air India for our trip from the UK to Goa because they offered the most convenient connection through Mumbai with minimal stopover time. It also offered very good value for money. Then I read the very negative reviews on this site and began to wish we hadn't. However our experience was very positive. This review is of the Mumbai to London long haul leg but it equally applies to our outbound leg. The connection at Mumbai is rather chaotic and involves a lot of different people stamping boarding cards and luggage labels to no good purpose after our internal flight from Goa. We then had a short wait in the terminal before the gate showed as open. There were no announcements at the gate then suddenly it was a hurry for everyone to board at once. No seat row priority. However we were near the front of economy so that wasn't a problem. Seats in economy on the 787 have comparatively generous legroom and are slightly wider than normal. Overall very comfortable with quite a lot of recline if you want it, and a foot rest if you have short legs. The flight was all in daylight, taking off at 07.00 and landing 11.30 (local times). The 787's electronic window blinds were effective in reducing solar glare and the cabin lighting made for a restful experience. IFE had a good range of Hollywood and Bollywood films, with a few recent releases and some older Hoclassics. TV channels in English were exclusively American shows, some well known comedies but the rest very mediochre. The audio channel has no western music, best bring your own. A map is available with various view options. On the outbound flight the touchscreen was problematic but inbound it worked perfectly. We had two full meals on this ten hour flight. A full hot breakfast soon after we took off and hot lunch a couple of hours before landing. It's a long time since I've had such good good on a long haul, full service carrier. Usually you get one meal and a snack. Drinks were served (with peanuts) some while before lunch. No more alcoholic drinks were offered but they were available from the galley if you asked. We had opted for a standard meal, which on Air India means some kind of curry. I found it tasty and well spiced without being overpowering. They had in fact run out of the non-veg lunch option by the time we were served but we were given a vegetarian curry with a seperate side dish of chicken curry. Excellent service. On many airlines you would just have to put up with what was left. Tea and coffee were served after lunch (tea first). Cabin crew offered water regularly throughout the flight to keep passengers hydrated. Despite this being a day flight the cabin lighting was kept dim and I was able to get several hours sleep.. Several reviews here comment on the bad state of the toilets. There were no such problems on either of our flights. Everything was as clean as any western airline. I suppose you might have a bad experience going into a toilet after someone has been ill, or made a mess, but that can happen on any airline. Air India has just as high standards of cleanliness as any other major carrier. In one sense Air India is like travelling back in time. The in flight service is old school full service. Nothing is skimped. Even the in flight magazine has interesting and well written articles to read, it isn't just a shopping catalogue. Cabin crew were uniformly courteous and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Air India again, especially on the 787.",Air India,2017,3

Events as follows: 1) Outbound flight Mumbai to Goa - scheduled itinerary change, ie the flight was moved back - this didn't cause me a massive problem but was symptomatic of further issues ahead. 2) Return flight Goa to Mumbai - frequent scheduled itinerary change emails and an email for me to change to an earlier flight (by 13hrs). The changes reduced the window for my connecting flight back to the UK, however Air India said I would still catch the flight ok. Flight was actually delayed by 3 hours, consequently I missed my flight back to London. Air India said that because the flights were bought on different tickets they would not get me home. Additional flight purchased to London as a result. My hold luggage got to Mumbai but has been lost, hence, I have no hesitation in rating as Air India as a 1/10 and have since learned they are notorious, please be warned and do not be attracted by their headline cheap flights.

I seated to wait after dinner. I had transit flight got headache. I went to washroom and ask a gentleman if possible to have cup of tea please, he said "" of course"". The lady who refused me before was came to me and asked why I am asking him tea as she just told me to wait after dinner. I told her that sorry but I am allowed to have tea. This is a small incident. Dinner was served. It was a different lady walking through by my seat. I stopped her and request her may I please have cup of water, she was very angry. I thought she did not hear me properly, I asked her a bit louder again. She started arguing with me why I am shouting at her. I said I am not shouting you I thought you did not hear me. I would like to have cup of water for my tablets please. She never came back. Very bad service.

Air India did a poor job of queue management both times. Even though they announced boarding by row, they still let anyone board regardless of seat number. This is especially frustrating because the predominantly indian crowd on either flight seemed to enjoy pushing their way through while ignoring the line of people actually waiting patiently. The seats were uncomfortable and didn't have enough cushioning especially when reclined. It felt like you were sitting on metal when the seat was reclined. This made a 14 hour flight almost painful. The bathrooms were just gross. In the first flight, there was pee on the bathroom floor that did not get cleaned up for the entire flight. The 'cleaning' by flight attendants involved regularly spraying air freshener in the lavatories. On the return flight, there wasn't even a soap dispenser! The soap was in a plastic water bottle with a crude hole punched on the top. The entertainment options were a coin toss. On one of the flights, the TV simply did not work even after they tried to reset it multiple times. On the flight that it did actually work, the entertainment options in English were limited and outdated. On the plus side however, there were 3 meal services (United only does 2 on a similar length flight). And the food tasted decent. Not good, but not bad either.",Air India,2017,3

Without toilet, food or anything! After this 2 hours they gave me just the boarding pass until Delhi and I had to run carrying my son and all the luggage to the boarding as this had started already. Really stressful! My son was starving and already to tired to eat. Luckily I ordered a bassinet in advance for the whole flight. When we arrived in Delhi we had a 3 hours stopover. And again they kept us 3 hours in front of the security check because of the boarding pass. No toilets, no food again - just hard chairs to wait on. I was really desperate as my son was just crying.

The flight was comfortable, the seat and legroom was great (and I'm over 6 feet tall); Economy class has an amazing seat pitch on the Air India Dreamliner. Since my flight arrived in Delhi in the evening, and the connecting flight to Paris left in the afternoon the following day, I got a hotel voucher when I departed Sydney (mind you, I had to specifically ask for it at the gate). Customs at Delhi is fussy, and it all feels quite rushed and disorderly, but the hotel room was comfortable and came with dinner, breakfast and lunch included (again, they don't tell you this, but if you ask, you can have all three). Service onboard was absolutely awful on the SYD–DEL leg, but acceptable on the other three legs of the full journey. Flight attendants on the first leg were rude, cold, unfriendly, was absolutely unprofessional. Entertainment options are pretty average; ugly UI and a dismal range of options, but I had my iPad to keep me busy. Food was great from Sydney to Delhi, but every other journey was pretty poor. Cold rock-hard bread buns, meat of questionable origin, and sometimes I just got asked ""vegetarian or non-vegetarian?"" with no clue what I was actually going to eat. Snacks between meals are a no-go, only peanuts and water / juice / coca-cola, which are self-serve while the FAs were just sitting in the galley reading a book. At the time, I paid ~NZ$1600 return to Paris from Auckland, but at that price, I probably wouldn't fly with them again. However, I see a similar offering from Sydney to Frankfurt for a trip next year at NZ~$1200 and to be honest, I'd probably fly with them again since the price is really cheap. As long as you bring some snacks, a book or iPad, and a calm temperament, you'll survive at the very least.",Air India,2016,7

Firstly, we boarded the flight at 1305 in preparation for a 1345 departure. 1 hour later, no movement, the captain announced there was a problem with the fuel loaded which did not talley with the fuel gauge. A further 2 hours later he announced the Boeing engineer had arrived and they could see the problem being solved within 30 minutes. Nothing further for another 2 hours, ie 5 hours in total sitting on the Tarmac. No apology for the delay as the plane finally began taxiing and no communication from the flight deck at all throughout the 11.5 flight.

The call centre staff were extremely helpful and efficient. The process was quick and hassle free. Airport Staff are quite friendly. Check in process was smooth enough. Ground staff at Delhi airport were quite helpful in aiding the international transfer. The aircraft itself has to improve. There were some shabby patchworks (especially seat upholstry and remote of the entertainment system). The international flight was a wee bit better than the domestic flight, though not great. Cabin Crew were friendly, though a bit cold in their demeanour. Their response time can improve. However the worst experience of this entire trip was on our flight from Paris to Delhi, there seemed to be a shortage of water on board.

I tried to complain, but after filling in the extraordinarily long list of requirements on the website complaint form the submit button would not function. Utterly diabolical. Onboard service and food are abysmal and ground staff pretty awful too, without any real courtesy towards business class passengers spending thousands of pounds (on one flight they tried to downgrade me to economy class without explanation and only relented when I began to phone a Indian Union Cabinet Minister friend).

I flew from Mumbai to Delhi to connect with AI314 to Hong Kong, departing at 11pm. In Delhi I lost my boarding pass, and alerted the crew at the gate immediately. They sent me running to the duty free to check if they had found it, but when I ran back telling them that I didn't find it, they told me they wouldn't be able to reissue me with a new one, and that I'd have to rebook on the same flight 24 hours later. I had to watch the other passengers board and the flight depart, even though I had my ticket and passport handy. What followed was an ordeal. I waited for an hour before anyone contacted me to help me go back through security, immigration, and get my luggage back. The Air India ground crew were a mixture of sympathetic and completely uncaring. It seemed impossible to speak to the same staff member twice, and no one actioned anything unless I pushed and pushed. After 4 hours, I finally managed to clear customs and security. They made me rebook the flight for approximately US$300. I then handed my passport to the check-in counter manager and waited for my luggage. After an hour, I spoke to a new staff member, who clarified that nothing had been done yet. The lady I spoke to initially clearly didn't initiate any effort to get my luggage for me. This process was repeated three times, each time speaking with someone else. The last person I spoke to couldn't even tell me who had my passport by this stage, asking me if I knew who I gave it to, which was outrageous. At this point I was also worried for my passport, as well as my luggage. Finally, sometime after 6:15am I finally managed to get my bag and leave the airport. This seven hour ordeal is not over yet, as I am writing this review from Delhi airport, 27 hours after initially leaving Mumbai. The direct flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong is only just over 5 hours.

I may have lost my boarding pass, but these things happen, and some understanding and assistance on their part would have been greatly appreciated. To add to my negative experience, two of their crew told me - separately - that they would have issued me with a new boarding pass had they been working at the desk at the time.

We chose air india for our flight from Sydney to the UAE as we wanted to spend our star alliance miles. I am glad having spent only miles, would have felt much worse if we would have paid full for the flight. We had a comparably modern Boeing 787 but on our initial flight one of the in-seat monitors was broken. Business class was quite empty so we could change seats. On our next flight, one of the remote controls was broken, so another change of seats. This time it was only one of the headphones which was broken, and could be replaced. You could say we had bad luck, but we got the clear impression that the crew wasn't really interested in the malfunctions. And I doubt they noted them in the logbook for future repair. We had booked special menus, ""vegan"" to be precise. Now, usually our expectations are low, but with an airline from a country where there are hundreds of millions vegetarians, what should go wrong? They seems to think that butter and Greek yoghurt are not animal products, and the vegan main dishes were the most primitive and tasteless we had in a long while. The service on board might be a cultural difference (this is more a hint for others than a criticism), but the crew is hardly offering anything without being explicitly asked for it. So don't expect anyone to come and bring you a bottle of water during your 13hr flight. Don't be shy and ping them again and again. We saw other (Indian) passengers doing this all the time. The entertainment system : I don't remember any other airline with so few and so old movies in the catalog. Funny enough : two of them were Christmas movies - in April. For the Germans, some titles come with German audio, but you won't find them in the menu under ""German"" but have to try-and-error the English movies. Only once you select ""Play"" there are sometimes German audio tracks offered. We were very disappointed.

Once we were in the plane for our 13-hour journey, it was downhill. Plane was delayed another hour due to ""baggage problems"" while we sat in the cabin. No infant seatbelts. No crew checking passengers for safe takeoff and landing. No greeting or anything from the captain. Plane in darkness for 13 hours (no window blinds, dark tinted windows that we couldn't control) except for food service. No one responding to passengers calls for service. I had to go to the galley each time I needed a drink, where the crew were chatting behind a curtain and ignoring all the passenger service calls. During food service, attendant spilt hot coffee over my mother with no apology. Ordinary food. When we landed in Delhi, after waiting for ages for our luggage at the carousel, we finally approached a staff member (we noticed others doing the same) who let us know all our baggage was still in Melbourne and would take 2 days to arrive. It wasn't lost, they just left it there. They knew they were leaving Melbourne without a planeload of luggage (we were told some bull story about temperature being too high) and didn't even have the courtesy to tell us not to wait at the carousel in Delhi. No notification, no apology. There followed another chunk of time full of confusion, filling in lost luggage forms with a planeload of other passengers, and seeing a bunch of clueless, disorganised staff around the airport. No compensation except a tiny bottle of water. Honestly, considering they should have had 13 hours of foreknowledge about receiving a planeload of grumpy, luggage less passengers, they could have handled it a lot better.

FA's were young and answered the call button that my kids pressed a few times. IFE was better and had good selection of latest Hollywood movies.

Breakfast, frozen melon and cold omelette with 2 frankfurters plus something in the corner of the dish which I have no idea what it was. Lunch, frozen curry, frozen salad and an ice cold bread roll, really appetising to say the least. The cabin crew warmed the meal up twice but it was still frozen. The plus side if there was one was the cost of the flight, saved us almost a £1000 on the 4 tickets in total so I think the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" sums up Air India.

Air India staff (head inflight attendant) told me to go keep it somewhere else or just leave it on the floor! Note: this is the response for a First Class Passenger! Meals were not served in First Class (at least the breakfast). No one came and spoke to you or welcomed you. If meals were served on-demand, on should let the passenger know - right? It was different when checking in though - staff escorted you to the lounge. For some reason, food items that need to be cold (cheese especially) were all in room temperature - not sure why and was not appealing to the taste buds. Food presentation was horrible. Inconsistent service and very chaotic inside the plane throughout the flight. There was no orderliness. Air India is cutting costs and one can tell. Entertainment sucks - especially the TV quality. Inflight map did not work. Looking at flight attendants and their attitude one wonders how they would cope in emergencies. I will not fly them again.",Air India,2015,8

Service was excellent cabin is quiet and private (only 3 passengers going, 5 on way back). I also went Delhi to Calcutta business class on Boeing 777, and the cabin was tired. Returning from Calcutta business was full so I had to fly economy. Oh my god, I know what people here are talking about. It was horrible. Staff are not interested in anything.

For several years I have travelled Air India, this was the first time my carry-on was checked for weight, but this is a welcome change that ultimately makes it so much more convenient for all the passengers. After boarding, we were kept waiting for the flight to take off, and were later informed that due to a technical snag, there would be a delay. Finally, after a delay of almost two hours, we took off for our destination. Air India have deteriorated in terms of food quality in the past couple of years, and I had little expectations from the in-flight meal. The food was bland, a spinach-based curry which tasted awful, and their signature bad bread. The IFE didn't have a lot of options, but the interface itself was okay. The headphones were sub-standard and not up to the mark. This was a big disappointment, considering that it's a long-haul flight lasting just a little under 15 hours. Service was okay-ish, the stewardesses just seemed to be doing their jobs. I felt there was a need for them to brush up their spoken-English, announcements were being made in poor English. Minor problem, but something that can be worked on. The cabin itself was good, the lavatories were surprisingly clean, and the seats were quite comfortable. Apart from the food and IFE, the journey itself was quite pleasing and 15 hours passed quickly.

This is a new plane and route introduced by Air India this year but the state of the plane was abysmal. The carpets had stains and the seats looked like they had been in use for many years. I expect some wear and tear but  they have to do a better job with the upkeep. The cabin service was the worst I have ever experienced in a plane. Refreshments were not offered after take-off. The cabin crew couldn't care less about the safety of the passengers because they didn't do a double check on the safety belts, and no restrictions on electronic devices were imposed. It seemed to me that the attendants on my flight took every opportunity to sit and rest when the rest of us had empty trays sitting out. About 2 hours into the flight, I needed a glass of water. I pressed the Call button and waited for about 30 minutes. I was not the only one. I saw a lot of lights lit up in our section - no refreshments were offered. To my surprise, the attendant went to the small control screen near the exit door and turned off all the call lights! Nobody bothered to check on any of the passengers. Irate, I went up front and confronted one of the attendants. She said, point blank, that she was taking care of 'other things.' Was she flying the plane?

The only negative is that the movies were dated - but I was okay with a re-run of Batman, which just about put me to sleep.

The lie flat bed in business was excellent. Much more spacious than the United product or the Smartium business bed on Asiana and others. The layout of the seats is a bit different - less privacy but more open feeling and real space. Comfy duvet and blankets provided on this night flight. Cabin crew although older (55+) were very well trained, warm, polite and efficient. They came around repeatedly talking to the passengers and making sure we were comfortable and seemed to genuinely care. In fact their efforts helped overcame the other deficiencies in the hard product. Compared to the brusque automatons on United these folks were full of smiles and eager to please. Also the Indian food selection was delicious. The negatives: compared to the premium airlines AI is clearly not as polished or well organized. Meals were provided all at once in a single tray - not course by course as on other airlines. Menus was not provided. Wine choice was very limited. Champagne was served lukewarm. After dinner the crew disappeared and did not patrol the aisles refilling glasses - but then passengers were asleep and I'm sure if anyone had requested they would have come right away. Movie selection though limited was not as bad as I had imagined. It would be nice to have served a quick snack or wake-up drink prior to landing. It was strange that the only announcement we got to wake us up was the one saying we were preparing to land! Overall a good product and definitely exceeded expectations.

No idea how this airline can be part of Star Alliance with their standard being so far behind. Almost all entertainment screens were broken - dirty floor and seats with stains - no water or toilet paper in the toilets - horrible food especially for people who can't handle spicy or lentils well - seats in A320 ridiculously close to each other, got constantly slammed by the guy in front of me. This felt even worse than Ryanair but they're at least cheap, also there was no entertainment on 4hr flight - security at Delhi Airport steals your vape and lighter even if you just transit but let's you pass with a custom half liter bottle with an unknown substance? I have no understanding for this behaviour at all, Security also was unfriendly and arrogant. Absurdly high fees for change of flight data if ticket not eligible for online change (360€ for 1 day later), might be like this with other carriers as well but I don't like it. Actually the only good thing I can say is that you can take 2 big suitcases while Air France, KLM, Lufthansa ... try to rip you off here and offer long distance flight fares even without any luggage which messes up the results of flight search engines. I will avoid both Indian airports and Air India in the future, that was by far the lowest standard I have ever experienced by an airline flying to Europe. ",Spicejet,2024,8

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to Chandigarh,2023-12-01,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," The Airline was on a downhill spiral since almost 16 years if not more. When the Tata's took over people had high hope for its recovery. However even after 28 months things are as bad if not worse. I avoid flying this airline and rarely do unless I have no better options. It's a big let down for a Tata company. I do not know if there is any other business in this group that is anywhere even close to as bad as Air India is now. I also feel one reason the airline cannot improve is due to the guy at the top Campbell Wilson. This guy has a lot of management experience but most is for a budget airline and he is trying to run it in that manner. Just a recent example is the reduction of baggage allowance for domestic flights to 16 kgs for Economy passengers. This guy says this is in line with the industry trend. Well I don't think so unless he is comparing with the budget airlines. Even Japan Airlines offers 2x 23 kgs on its domestic flights. So what is the difference between AI and the other budget airlines, offering the same 15 kgs. In my recent case they advanced the timing of my flight which did not suit me as it did not give me enough time to connect with my Inbound flight from Tokyo. I called and pleaded that the new timing will not suit me and therefore I wish to cancel. I was told that I can cancel but there will be no refund. I have never had issues with their Star Alliance partner airlines when they change flight timings and I get a full refund in case of cancellation. Not only Star Alliance but numerous airlines with One World and Sky Team offer a full refund if new flight timings do not suit. Obviously this is another similarity with Budget Airlines. I definitely cannot recommend this airline in it's current avatar unless there is a drastic change which I do not see happening any time soon, definitely not under a CEO who is trying to run it as a budget airline. I also understand that the airline is currently at a loss. However with poor management and bad decisions they are losing further loyalty.",Spicejet,2023,12
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Melbourne to Hyderabad via Delhi,2024-05-01,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  My recent experience with Air India on a long-haul flight from Melbourne to Hyderabad was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, the journey was marred by a series of disappointments and discomforts that left me deeply dissatisfied.  The food served was not only of poor quality, but it was also presented in a manner that suggested utter disregard for basic hygiene standards. Packages were not just messy inside but also had spills all over the exterior, making the already unappetizing meals even less appealing. To add insult to injury, the taste was abysmal, and the quality of desserts was subpar, failing to meet even the most basic expectations. Moving on to the condition of the aircraft itself, the state of the toilets was deplorable. Broken toilet doors and malfunctioning facilities resulted in a pervasive stench that permeated the seating area, creating an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere for passengers. It's unacceptable to subject paying customers to such unsanitary conditions. Furthermore, the lack of inflight entertainment for a significant portion of the seats is simply inexcusable in this day and age. With technology readily available, there's no reason why passengers should be deprived of this basic amenity, especially during a lengthy 20-hour flight. Speaking of discomfort, the seating arrangements were far from satisfactory. Uncomfortable seats made the already arduous journey even more taxing, leaving passengers feeling physically strained and restless. And if the in-flight experience wasn't bad enough, the ordeal continued upon arrival at Delhi airport. The mishandling of baggage collection, with staff carelessly pulling out bags from the belt and haphazardly placing them outside, created chaos and confusion among passengers trying to locate their belongings. In conclusion, my experience with Air India was nothing short of a disaster from start to finish. The combination of poor food quality, unsanitary conditions, lack of entertainment, uncomfortable seating, and chaotic baggage handling has left me with a strong resolve never to fly with them again. It's truly disappointing to see such a renowned airline fall so far below acceptable standards, and I urge prospective passengers to think twice before considering Air India for their travels.",Spicejet,2024,5

Dealing with Air India has been nothing short of a nightmare. While they did answer my initial calls, their promise of a callback was nothing but empty words, leaving me stranded without assistance. After over ten phone calls and spending more than ten hours on hold, they finally claimed to have found a flight for me and confirmed the booking. However, it turned out to be a lie. They falsely claimed that EL AL had canceled their part of the flight, when in reality, they hadn't. This deceitful behavior only added to the frustration of the situation. Their failure to provide an alternative flight after canceling mine, as required by law, further compounded the issue.

Well, more than uncertain. When we boarded the plane, the cabin was heated to around 35°, which remained the case for the first 1.5 hours or so of the flight.  The seatbelt indicator lights did not work either. This perceived safety problem was compounded by the overall condition of the aircraft. While the entertainment system at my wife's seat didn't work on the outward flight, it practically failed throughout the entire plane on the return flight. And that on a long-haul flight. In addition, one toilet didn't work, my seat back was in a catastrophic state and one toilet was out of order. In another, the washbasin was provisionally glued down so that it didn't fall off the wall. Do you feel comfortable and safe? A clear no. It's also cheeky: when checking in online 48 hours before departure, the seats are displayed. Our two seats offered at no extra cost were in different rows. If we wanted to sit together or enjoy a bit more legroom, we had to pay extra. Coincidentally, relatives of ours were flying from Frankfurt to Singapore the same week. Here, too, the decision was made: No more Air India. After a lengthy back and forth with Air India, we were granted around 120 euros in compensation for both passengers.

As a paying Business Class traveler, this inconsistency was quite evident and left me perplexed. Whenever I requested assistance from the flight attendants, their standard reply was, “We’ll take care of it for your side later.” Unfortunately, these assurances rarely translated into action. Whether it was headphones, desserts, or other amenities, the promised items often failed to materialize. Strongly urge the management to implement better checks and balances.

I dont have any issues with them laughing and talking , it is their right. My problem is why they kept turning off the help calls? I explained that the inflight entertainment did not work.

The plane was supposed to have inflight entertainment but the majority of the screens were not working. Might be a problem in one plane but as it was the same on both flights it is most probably a systematic problem. Please prepare to have your own entertainment with you. The food onboard was really bad (normally I like the kind of food served in India but this was really bad). Take something to eat with you if you are foolish enough to go by Air india. The plane was dirty and even though the space was fairly good I would warn you for the not so pleasant flight. Service was ok but the limits of all type of drinks was not good (I only drink nonalcoholic and still there was limits). My travel was delayed by almost 5 hours and that was according to the staff on the ground due to technical problems at first and then after finding an alternative plane they needed another crew as the other had to many hours.

Supposed to take off at 2:15pm on 13th Jan from Delhi. Firstly I reach the check in Counter at 11:45 am and stood in the queue. There are so many counters for air India but any counter is not for a particular air India flight which males is so difficult for passengers as almost every passenger is asking the staff is this line for Sydney or Dubai or London or xyz destination. Secondly there were so long queue that by the time I reached the actual counter 1hr and 15 mins have already passed by. So finally at 1pm I reached the counter and handed my passport to the staff so they can check in and initiate a baggage drop. While the staff was checking my flight details I just got an sms that my flight has been delayed by 2 hrs and will now take off at 4:30 pm instead of 2:15 pm . Then the staff had a look and told me since your flight is now delayed to 4:30pm we cannot check you in you are too early for the flight, go and rest and come back in 1 hr and we should be able to check you in. So which means I had already waster 1hr and 15 mins in the queue then the flight is delayed by 2 hrs; after that I have to wait for another 1hr then stand in line again and then check in my luggage. What a waste of time. 1hr later at roughly around 2:15 pm I went to the counter again to check and she said your check in was already open about 2 hrs ago and that the person you spoke to earlier had given wrong information. Finally I did a baggage drop and went further for a security check. After security we went and waited for boarding as now the boarding was only going to happen at 4pm I still had another 1 hr with nothing to do. I had thought I will be in flight already 2:15 they would give food but now the flight is late by 2 hrs so no food for another 2 hrs and they did not compensate us with any complimentary food at the airport either. Slowly some time passed by and at 3:45 there was another announcement that the flight is now further delayed to a 5:30 take off. This meant that there has been a 3 hr delay from the original scheduled time of take off. Then at 4:45 finally they started the boarding so finally I had some relief and thought ok no more delays now . Almost everyone was seated in the flight and at 5:15 i heard another announcement that they are waiting for 1 passe ger as they have not yet boarded the flight. 10 minutes the passenger finally came. The flight finally started a take off at 5:45 pm. After all this once the flight was in the air around 6:15 pm they made an announcement that the seat belt sign is off and they provide snacks in some time. Finally at 6:45 they provided snacks and drinks.  Also from the time I sat in the plan the TV was not working at all. I informed them and they said they are serving food so they will do a reset after they finish with the food. They started serving food at 6:45 pm and finished by 7:45 pm . I told then again about the TV and they said they will go and reset now and it would then take 20 minutes to reset and come back up. So I thought probably by 8:15 at least I should be able to watch something . Once the reset was completed and I turned on the TV but still it was not fixed.

Our luggage was lost with no support or communication from the airline. The lack of empathy and remorse in the way customers were treated is unacceptable. Seeking assistance from a supervisor resulted in extra-long wait times, only to be met with dismissive attitudes. Holding a grudge for asking for help is not the kind of service one expects. I had essential medication in my suitcase, and despite carrying only a 2-day supply in my hand luggage, the lost baggage left me in a dire situation. It's now day 3, and there's still no news on the baggage. Additionally, there's been no communication regarding a claim or compensation for the inconvenience caused. The airline changed/cancelled my flight without any prior notification, causing unnecessary stress and inconvenience.  When faced with a modified flight, I had no flexibility and was forced to choose their option.

The onward journey was quite disappointing with a dilapidated aircraft. The tray tables were falling apart and had to be carefully assembled into place and up. Though there were seat back screens, only very few lucky passengers enjoyed any IFE but none in my row. The crew offered some inane apology and reset the server but there wasn't any improvement. But for my backup on my phone, it would have been an excruciating 15 hours to Delhi which the passenger next to me endured. Of the three meals served, two were almost the same. The caterer or the menu designer have to be changed immediately so that the passengers are not fed almost identical ill-prepared meals in quick succession. The toilets deteriorate rapidly as the flight progresses ending up as unusable as the flight nears the destination. Can the crew please provide enough TP for the entire flight?

Specially “Mr. Avishek Dhar” helped me a lot by managing my luggage to make it through travel till JFK so that I have a comfortable trip with the baby. Also baggage allowance for international flight was allowed in domestic flight according to Air India policy. All in all they have done a commendable job to make me go stress free the whole trip.

Family Leisure,Business Class,New Jersey to Hyderabad via Delhi,2023-11-01,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0,2.0,"  My experience with Air India was challenging due to the itinerary and service encountered during the journey. The flights had extended layovers – a 4-5 hour stopover in Delhi on the way to Hyderabad and an 11-hour stopover in Mumbai on the return journey to New Jersey. This lengthy wait was quite arduous and left a lasting impression. Regarding the in-flight service, it was satisfactory, although the food served from Mumbai to EWR lacked authenticity and didn't meet expectations. At Delhi airport, I was pleasantly surprised by its cleanliness and modern infrastructure. However, there was a noticeable struggle to maintain cleanliness due to some individuals littering, which affected the overall ambiance. On the other hand, Mumbai airport was extremely crowded, and I faced challenges with uncooperative staff. Despite my long-haul flight, 11-hour stopover, and having a sick child with me, both immigration officers and Air India staff were unhelpful and showed reluctance. Their lack of empathy was evident, with one supervisor even making a disparaging comment suggesting I 'try my luck' with immigration. This was a disappointing and rude response. I strongly urge Air India's customer-facing staff to undergo training in empathy and kindness. As a business class passenger, enduring an 11-hour layover with unhelpful staff was a significant inconvenience and a negative experience. I rate my experience a 2 out of 10 specifically due to the unhelpful and rude behavior encountered with Air India staff at Mumbai airport. Such attitudes are unacceptable when dealing with customers who expect better service standards.",Spicejet,2023,11
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Cochin,2023-05-01,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  My Mother passed away May 21, 2023. I booked an Air India flight to travel May 21, 2023 from SFO to COK to attend her funeral. My family scheduled her funeral accordingly so I could attend the funeral. I was supposed to land in Kerala May 23rd at 0700 a.m. in plenty of time to attend her funeral the same day at 3pm. My mother’s house is just 30 minutes from the airport, and I would have plenty of time to reach home a few hours before the funeral. But unfortunately, I couldn’t attend the funeral because the Air India flight was delayed at SFO for several hours causing me to miss the layover flight to go to Kerala. I explained my emergency to everyone who were responsible, but the Air India staff didn’t care about it and rescheduled a flight that wouldn’t reach Kerala until 7pm causing me to miss my mother’s funeral. It is important in my culture and religious belief to be present for the funeral and events following. How can I ever reconcile this situation in my life in my heart? The traumatic experience I had with flying Air India and missing of my mother’s funeral is still difficult to come to terms with. It took me a long time to even write my experience in this portal. Unfortunately, this wasn’t an isolated example of poor service on this flight. On return to SFO the luggage was delayed 2.5 hours! We were given the reason for the delay as “there was no baggage workers to take the bags off the plain.” Not only was my time wasted but my transportation home was waiting for almost three hours. This is completely unacceptable. I have been a frequent international flyer for years, on many different airlines, and I was expecting a much better experience with Air India since TATA took over. Disappointedly, my experience was much worse than ever before. I was shocked to realize that Air India doesn’t have a suitable plan to deal with emergency situations like this. Air India will not be an airline of consideration for future travels because I don’t trust their reliability getting me to my destination for important life events. I feel like Air India doubled my traumatic experience, my mother passing compounded by not attending the funeral. This is a regret that I must live with for the rest of my life.",Spicejet,2023,5

However, the food I was very highly dissatisfied with. They started our journey with cold baba ghanouj, and cold hummus with hard bread. That as a starter no one seemed to enjoy. Out of the Asian elders did not even know what baba ghanouj was. An elder couple behind me asked them to help me with their order as they were wanted veg only. I was happy to help. For the main course, it was an option between paneer or millet steak (vegetarian). As the air hostess was coming around to take our order, she tried to convince me and my family to order the millet steak saying it’s very good. I told her I would not like that, and I wanted the paneer. After two mins she came to inform us they all are out of panner and the rest of us will get millet steak. I was seating in seat number 9; I couldn’t imagine why we paid so much more for business class; when we didn’t even have a choice what we want as a main meal. The millet steak was so disgusting. Everyone behind me and towards the back of business class was upset. Finally towards our landing, we were served frozen chat and a “veg grilled sandwich” which was in fact only bread and cold squash in it.

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to San Francisco ,2023-09-01,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,0,2.0," My family and I have consistently had disappointing experiences when traveling with Air India. This time, it was my parents' first trip from New Delhi to San Francisco, leaving much to be desired. I had explicitly booked extra legroom seats for my parents, as it was a gruelling 16-hour flight, and I paid for these seats when I booked the tickets. However, upon boarding the plane, my parents were assigned seats in the middle section, as the extra legroom seats they had paid for had been given to other passengers who made a last-minute payment for those seats at the airport. This was not an isolated incident. A similar situation occurred in 2022 when my husband and brother traveled from New Delhi to San Francisco. To their surprise, their extra legroom seats were also sold to other passengers during check-in. It's evident that this is not a mere mistake but a recurring issue. It's deeply concerning that Air India's ground staff and crew members seem complicit in this practice. It appears they are profiting from this by allowing passengers to book extra legroom seats online, only to resell the same seats for additional rupees to other passengers during check-in. My parents were left with no other options, and the crew members displayed extreme rudeness by suggesting that my parents deboard and resolve the issue at the check-in counter. This is a clear indication that there's a systemic problem within Air India, and this practice is tarnishing the airline's reputation. To make matters worse, I applied for a refund, but Air India never refunded the money my parents paid for these extra legroom seats. This entire experience has left us deeply disappointed and frustrated, and it raises serious questions about the integrity and customer service standards of Air India. Such practices are unethical and damaging to the airline's reputation.

To begin with, the aircraft on both journeys appeared to be in a state of disrepair. The seats were worn out, uncomfortable, and lacked proper cushioning. The tray tables were broken in several instances, making it difficult to utilize them for any purpose. The in-flight entertainment system, or lack thereof, was another major issue. On both flights, the screens were either malfunctioning or next to non-existent. My family was left with no entertainment options during the entire duration of the journey, which was particularly disheartening considering the long hours spent onboard. Moreover, the meal service on these flights was subpar. The food quality was far from satisfactory, with unappetizing taste and limited options. As a vegetarian, I found the lack of suitable choices even more disappointing.

I visited India after 1.5 years and was talking sweets with me to Berlin from the duty free products for which there was a rule ""it wasn't included!"". But suddenly Air India have to weigh after security is done just to earn money! Staff members at the gate were so excited to earn 4500 Rs per kg for 5kgs overweight in the hand luggage that was increased when I brought Duty Free. I have seen now Air India has downgraded its royalty in my eyes. The employees at the gate asked me to throw all the stuff including the sweets.

The next flight was two days after and we were stuck in Delhi and they refused to cover the minimum of the hotel for two days (they only gave us refund for one night). They promised to refund the taxi back to the airport but this didn't happen as well. In the airport, they lost our new ticket and it took an hour to get it back. We spent hours to argue with the workers of the airline and it were not honest. They promised lot of things but they were tricking us with all kind of excuses that were not real (they said there isn't more ticket in an other flight, and indeed there were, they said the manager left home and indeed he was there, and so on). Bottom line - we had a lot of expenses due to Air India improper service. We paid one night hotel, the taxi to the airport, food and living expenses and of course we lost two days of work at home.

The Flight AI687/07Aug BOM DEL departure was revised at 1800hrs without giving any reason to passengers. Due to the delayed departure of AI687/07Aug BOM DEL, they were rescheduled to fly on the next day after 24 hrs. Had AI staff tried and communicated with staff in Delhi, there was a possibility to be able to catch onward flight for Tokyo. But no such attempt was even tried by the staff. There were other direct flights from DEL-Tyo (ANA or JAL) on same day which could have been the next option. But no sincere attempts were made. As a result, my in-laws lost one complete day. They were then sent to hotel Sukh at Juhu. To travel to hotel it took 3 hrs taxi ride and while coming back it was 2 hrs. My in-laws started their Journey from Nashik at 6 am in morning and could only reach the hotel at 9 pm. It could have been so easily a hotel near airport. On second day (8-Aug), they were picked up at around 11:00 am and made to catch 3:30 pm flight without lunch being offered. The hotel even didn’t have basic facilities like soap availability. As a common traveler, I can easily understand that 4:00 pm flight being very important for travelers who connect to other international flights from Delhi. There should be alternative arrangements to make people catch the connecting flights. If it was known that 4:00 pm flight is going to be delayed and there is no other flight available until 6:00 pm, why efforts were not made to accommodate few passengers who have connections in earlier 3:30 pm We had to cancel all arrangements made for their pick up and re-book the car with driver from Tokyo.

Business,Economy Class,Dubai to Kochi,2023-07-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,3.0,"  Disappointing Experience. I recently traveled on Air India from Cochin to Dubai on July 12th, and returned from Dubai to Cochin on July 17th. I am writing to express my disappointment with the overall experience and share my feedback regarding the flight. When I booked my tickets, I had high expectations, considering that Tata Group had taken over Air India. However, I was disheartened to discover that the flight experience was no different from a low-budget airline, especially when compared to the services provided by airlines like Emirates or Qatar Airways. It was quite disconcerting to find that Air India, which is still considered a low-cost carrier, had higher prices compared to other budget airlines. Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention an incident that occurred during my return journey. During check-in, I had checked in baggage weighing 26.5 kg and carried a hand luggage of 7 kg. At no point during the check-in process did the counter staff inform me that there was an opportunity to accommodate an additional 4 kg of weight, which would have allowed me to make purchases from the duty-free area. Instead, I was informed just before boarding that there would be a weight check, and any excess weight would be subject to an additional charge of 50 dirhams per kilogram. This approach to charging passengers for excess weight without prior information or the chance to adjust the baggage is disheartening, especially considering the concept of making money seems to overshadow the overall passenger experience. To comply with the sudden weight restriction, I had to rush back to the duty-free area and drop the items I had purchased. I was warned by your staff that I might face deportation if I delayed the process. As a Gold member of Qatar Airways, I am familiar with the rules and consequences of deportations, so I complied without any arguments and quickly resolved the issue. This incident has left a significant impact on my perception of Indian airlines. I now question the level of service and commitment to passenger comfort offered by airlines, whether it is Air India under Tata ownership or any other Indian carrier. The flight experience itself was underwhelming, with seats resembling those found on ordinary buses, causing discomfort and subsequent back pain. Considering the recent acquisition by Tata Group, I had hoped for a significant improvement in Air India's services, but unfortunately, it seems that Air India remains unchanged. It is disheartening to witness a lack of luxury or any additional features that are commonly associated with globally recognized and exclusive airlines. This experience has left me deeply disappointed, and I feel compelled to share my concerns with you. I hope that my feedback can serve as a catalyst for necessary improvements in your services and customer experience. As a frequent traveler, I believe it is essential for airlines to prioritize passenger comfort, communication, and transparency to build a positive reputation. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I sincerely hope that Air India will take necessary steps to enhance its services in the future. ",Spicejet,2023,7

After waiting for what felt like an eternity, the Air India representatives finally approached us. They were polite, but there was something off about their response.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kolkata to Newark via Delhi,2023-06-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," Sometime around 2017 I got the patriotism bug. After avoiding Air India like a plague for years, I decided to travel with Air India. Well the first time from SFO-CCU and back wasn’t bad. However, as the years have progressed, Air India has gotten progressively worse. Yes, Air India seems to have gotten worse after the takeover of Tata. Without recounting every horror story that I have about Air India, I will simply, and briefly share my experience with Air India flying back from CCU to EWR on June 30, 2023. As we got to the airport I was prepared for the rudeness. The staff members of Indigo, Spice, etc., seemed to be treating their customers in a friendly manner, however, Air India staff seemed just sad, and pathetic. So then we get on our flight from CCU to DEL. The food is inedible, the AC doesn’t seem to be working, and the flight attendants were missing for the rest of the flight. Okay, so then we get to Delhi. Now, I don’t if it’s just an attitude issue, perhaps something cultural, in Delhi, or Air India. But Air India staff there are not only rude but also just pathetically incompetent. Somehow, I got called in for “a secondary inspection.” Apparently having a Zippo (without fuel) is not allowed by CISF. Anyway, so after being harassed by them, I get back to the gate and the Air India staff has somehow lost my boarding pass, which they had kept when I went to see the CISF people. Instead of apologizing and reissuing a pass two Air India staff kept arguing with me that they don’t have my boarding pass. Finally, they find it. Again no apology. So, I being exhausted, get on the flight. This time I had made sure to get on the flight early, since on my way to Kolkata, they could not find a space for my cabin luggage so I had to store them in two different overhead bins. So I was relieved when I saw the overhead bins empty (I had booked extra legroom seats). However, the moment I start putting my luggage, an anxious flight attendant runs towards me and starts scolding me. I inform her that it was my seat and I will keep my luggage there. She proceeds to tell me that the overhead bin is reserved for “oversized baggage.” So at this point, I lose my cool. So, let me understand this, instead of enforcing the rule regarding baggage size and weight, like a normal airline, Air India has decided to punish passengers who ARE following the rule. Anyway I told the flight attendant that I will be keeping my bag where it is and that’s that. She mumbled something about people brining 4 bags instead of 2. Whatever! However, somehow this flight attendant seemed to be the one serving my seat for the whole 14 hour flight. As expected the in-flight entertainment system did not work. Funnily the guy seating beside me had his remote literally torn off from his seat. However, I regret eating the pathetic food that Air India provided. I kid you not, the salad they gave was literally rotten. Didn’t they know that Mayonnaise rots very easily, and DOES NOT need to be warmed up? What was worse than the food was that the same flight attendant kept pushing my buttons throughout the flight. At some point, like a good passenger I had kept my trash ready to be given back to the attendant after dinner. However, when the attendant came, she seemed agitated, gestured toward the front of the flight, and said “You can throw it in.",Spicejet,2023,6

The cabin staff is nice and pretends that the problem is solvable, but they seem pretty aware that it is not.

My new name for Air India is Air Never Again. The seats, service, cleanliness and ticketing were all terrible. We flew nine carriers on our month-long trip. None of them were close to being as bad as Air India. The discount air carriers Scoop and Batik put Air India to shame. The direct competitors Singapore, United and Cathay were so far superior that you'd have to drug me and tie to a seat to ever get me to set foot on Air India again. The plane was filthy. The seats torture devices left over from the Middle Ages. My in-seat entertainment system was broken but functional. I pointed it out so that it might be serviced on the ground and got a, ""no, one cares shrug"". The service was non-existent. The flight attendants made two appearances and then were nowhere to be found after meal and drink service. They just disappeared while leaving water in the open galley. The food was the worst of any airline food I've eaten or tried to eat. The beverage service was miserly. Nope. One and done. Loved India. Been there several times.

We informed the crew member and she assured it will be fixed soon. Two hours later when I asked them again, all they had to say was ""sorry, we tried but only technical person will be able to fix it"". The meal they served was not fresh. My brother had booked non-veg option for meal when booking tickets and he got vegetarian meal, that too, 1 hour late than others and had hair in it. When we asked the crew, she said their economy meal was over so they are serving whatever they could arrange. You guys are not even aware how many people are flying with you, forget the rest.

Most probably they did not have to fuel or their was an issue between pilot and ground staff as the pilot after being coerced after nearly 4 hours of no response from him announced that ground staff will speak.

It is disappointing. At the airport after checking in for the international flight from Delhi to Toronto, my mother-in-law was harassed for return flight which was not booked at that time. Couple of staff members of the STAR ALLIANCE harassed her and took her boarding pass and refused to let her go to board on flight 45min before the departure of the flight to Toronto.

AI has given nothing but lousy service and that is being generous. I landed in Delhi at 11pm and my plane to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3.35am.

We boarded around 4 am and now it’s 7am and we are still sitting on the plane- a closed space, with people coughing. In 3 hours no water was even served and besides the initial announcement no updates to the passengers. We are being treated as cattle and not human beings. There’s no courtesy of keeping us in the loop. This is a broken down plane. Nothing works. For a 14 1/2 hour non-stop flight, there’s no entertainment. Honestly, at this point I wonder if I will get where I need to get, alive and in one piece. AI is playing with our lives and is being extremely disrespectful of our time.

Passengers were barred from entering the airport building as the flight was delayed to avoid overcrowding and a makeshift counter without personnel was arranged and of course without a proper seating facility. There were hardly 15 chairs for more than 100 people. As it is summer in Saudi Arabia the temperature outside was around 40 degrees Celsius. The airline representative appeared once in a while and responded rudely to any queries on flight status. Experience inside the plane is another horrible experience. We felt like we were in an airplane just because it was flying. Other than that it is comparable to local buses in developing countries.

After coming down to Goa airport there was a layover for about 5 hours and after standing in a cue for 1.5 hours for check in again the staff said you have to wait for ""30 minutes more"".

The major disappointments are old planes with no inflight entertainment, and incompetent and rude ground services. I would give the credits to cabin crews who tried their best to be helpful though. Check in staffs need to be better informed on visa requirements, so not to annoy customers with proper requirements waiting. India's chaotic airport security is already a nightmare, but a ground staff in Delhi made it worse. In my experience, airport security staffs made a horrible mistake of not stamping my boarding pass. And an Air India staff at the boarding gate was very rude as if I was someone with a security risk. He made me wait to board the plane last without a proper explanation, to a point that a security lady was nice enough to give a calming gesture and signalling the boarding staff is rather a rude one.",Spicejet,2023,5

Only crew at the back rows were very polite and decent, two female and one male member very nice. Very uncomfortable seats. The experience at the ground level was also pathetic as the ground staff was asking unnecessary questions which were not relevant at all. When one person has a visa of the country he or she is travelling to then even they were asking irrelevant questions as in where is the invitation letter, how many days is the stay for thought already shown the return ticket. Invitation letter is to be asked by the immigration dept not with the airline travelling with. Then after check in and immigration when finally entering in the aircraft again the person is asking where is the invite - what makes sense out of it, don't understand. It is just to unnecessarily harassing the passengers. I think we all are educated and we know the rules and regulations to be followed while travelling then why unnecessary harassment.

The footrests provided also gave a good impression. The food was decent. But the worst part about the flight was that my audio insertion socket was broken.

We finally boarded at 10:00 am and started taxiing; the flight was then aborted before takeoff for a new ‘technical issue’. All passengers were stranded on the plane for what seemed like an eternity before being offloaded on to a bus. The passengers were stuck on the bus for better part of an hour because the driver was not informed by the airline as to where to drop off the passengers. Finally, the passengers were taken to ‘arrival’ but not informed about where to collect their previously checked-in bags leading to total chaos. After collecting our bags we were asked to wait by the check-in counter for announcement regarding a replacement flight. During the entire fiasco, the Air India staff members at the airport were totally dysfunctional and incompetent. Nobody had a clue as to when we would be able to get on an alternative flight. The irate passengers had to wait by the counter without food or water for several hours before finally being accommodated on a flight late evening. An entire day was wasted waiting to get on a short flight. To add insult to injury, the airline staff members were found smirking behind the counters at the passengers who were understandably distressed at the situation.

The ground staff is inexperienced and incompetent. I flew from Delhi to JFK via Mumbai. And needless to say, I had a confirmed ticket in business class. In Delhi, Air India ground staff told me that they can not assign me seats for the flight from Mumbai to JFK. So they gave me a boarding pass for Mumbai to JFK flight, where in place of seat number it said ""STB"". I boarded the flight from Delhi to Mumbai, and upon arriving in Mumbai, went to the Air India counter in Mumbai to get my boarding pass for the Mumbai to JFK flight with a valid seat number. Now the fun part begins! I was talking to a young lady who appeared completely clueless on how to address this situation (layover). Unfortunately, I showed her the boarding pass that they gave me in Delhi. Remember ""STB"", which most likely was a way for them to communicate to the Mumbai staff the fact that the seat number is not assigned yet. The lady immediately calls for help. She discusses with the person who came to help. She first tells me that she needs time to process my ticket, as she wants to make sure me and my son are sitting next to each other. So I wait. After around 10-15 minutes, when I inquire again, she says she is trying her BEST but that I am on STANDBY! (Remember STB!). She said she needs to speak with her supervisor. I spent almost an hour at the counter and after yelling a bit on her and her supervisor, they finally gave me the boarding pass. But they took my Delhi to Mumbai boarding pass (perhaps my bad!) and I had to go back later to collect my checked in baggage receipt. Upon boarding the flight, the business class section I was in was almost empty, and they were repairing my seat! Not sure why they could not assign me some other seat which was in a working condition. The seat was torn, remote barely functioning with no flight map. Food was ok.

It's a complete disgrace.

Bathroom sinks were taped to hold it all together. I saw the crew members in total 5 times – take off, landing and when they served the 3 meals. No once came to check when there was turbulence or was there anyone present in the alleys. I can keep going but I am going to stop. I get it that Air India is trying to rebuild but this was beyond a horrible experience. A 14-hour flight with zero amenities, I call that torture.

Disgusting, not maintained aircraft. Filthy and uncomfortable in every sense of the word - ok this is not Air India's fault, but I was amongst 4 screaming toddlers the whole way. Lovely!

I paid more than $1500 to get to India from the US even though there were flights for $900. The reason is that Air India had a non-stop flight from the US. I tried to book online but had problems and had to call about changing my flight. Although I requested English speaking reps on the 800 number, all the people had only elementary understanding of English. And, for some reason, they would hang up the phone in mid-conversation. I even had a friend call and the same happened to her. I ended up talking another airline to India and flying back on Air India which was horrible and I do not recommend it. I also want to warn people. My card was charged almost $1517.49 Air India admitted the problem was on their end but I was only refunded $1253.66 For some reason they decided to keep $264.33 That is the first issue. The second was the actual flight.  I was shocked that they came around the cabin almost 2 hours into the flight with a dixie cup of water. I asked if they had a larger cup because I was very thirsty and the flight attendant either didn't understand English or she pretended she didn't understand English, because she shrugged and walked away.

The check in staff at Melbourne were pleasant, helpful and efficient. We had to queue but the line kept moving. The ground staff member was cheerful and upbeat and really seemed to enjoy talking to people and took pride in his job. Our boarding was on time and orderly and our flight departed exactly on time. The highlight was the attitude of the cabin crew.  During the twelve hour flight, our cabin crew were absolutely delightful: They looked happy and we had a nice chat about the Indian wines being served on Air India during the bar service. They emanated a sense of warmth and caring. The professionalism and warmth of the cabin crew on this flight was probably the best we have ever experienced.

Every time they assured that the money will be refunded within next seven days but this excuse has been repeated for about seven times till date but to no avail.

The touch screen didn't work, the USB charging port and the headphone jack connector was broken. The steward was handing out landing cards to certain passengers and they should have just informed the people over the intercom to identify themselves if they needed one, I had to call out to them and then comes a volley of questions, are you a foreign national, etc.. why do they care?

Despite being in Business class, there was no decent meal available for people, who wanted to eat light and non spicy food. Seeing this, we booked a blend and one jain meal on our return flight. Shockingly, the blend food was spicy and had garlic in it and jain meal was also too spicy. The crew expressed inability to provide us any alternative, even such as fruits. The baggage in Bangalore could be collected by us after 45 minutes, despite having 'priority' tag on it. On reaching Delhi Airport on 8th November, it was worst. The flight attendant announced belt number-1 for baggage collection at the time of de-boarding. We waited for 30 minutes and then started searching from belt to belt and finally found our baggage for IA-507, was off loaded on belt number-5. Again after waiting for a long time, we were able to finally collect baggage. Both sides, the experience was terrible. Also that a lady seated on a seat ahead of us behaved in a very rowdy manner throughout the flight. Despite my telling the flight attendant, she did nothing about it.

Welcome onboard by air hostesses was like as they are obliging me by allowing to board the flight. The seat was not fully operational with Digital screen. The handle/bar swivel was not aligned properly. Retractable desk was broken and screws missing and the hinges were with ‘wet’ adhesive. It appeared that they were either just pasted or wrong adhesive was used to stick the broken hinges/ swivel.  When opened the table, I was continuous holding the glass and water bottle, as it was not balanced, they were rolling towards centre. ( No turbulence). There was no connection to plug in the ear phone and the socket was missing. (I picked up ear phone from adjoining vacant seat). International flight of 14 hrs was not provided with sanitizer, face mask, eye mask, dental kit, shaving kit except the dirty throw blanket and pillow.  The newspaper shelves/ behind the front seat were too dirty and full of garbage.  The bulkheads had so many oily spots/ finger spots that they were not cleaned since many of the past flights.  Regarding welcome drinks there was no option other than Orange/ Apple juice or aerated water/ drinks and soda drinks. 1The digital screen had only 6 (classical) and 4 (recent) movies out of which few could not be screened. The map was continuous on “Flight Data not available”. Lunch was just like ‘Rice Plate’ available in Mumbai worth Rs 20/-. The cheapest desert, dried bun, no fruits. The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.  After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.  After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.  The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.  The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality.

This is the first time we are travelling in Air India. In air India even on a £800 ticket (there were 6 of us including a 2yr old, so £4800 in total) you feel poor and wants to get out of it as soon as possible. There were not even a colour pencil to entertain a 2yr old, I shouldn’t be complaining about that, should be glad we even got a seat (not comfortable though) to sit for 8hrs. The food was heavily salted and tasted cheap.  The flights were not on time (affected the transit time, so we had to run from one flight to next) but I not as bad as I heard before, at least Tata taking over has done some good. London via Delhi is not a good idea. When you come from London you need to check out and check in your luggage at Delhi again, so that takes min 2hrs in transit time (not to mention the porters and staff at Delhi trying to scam you) and you will almost miss your next flight of the first one was late to arrive in Delhi.

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Newark,2022-05-01,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,2.0,  Worst experience flying Air India. The plane from Mumbai to Newark was dilapidated and some of the seats were even broken (they were still assigned to customers). The in-flight entertainment did not work. The flight attendants seemed apathetic to pressing the request assistance button on the seats. The food was just OK. We had terrible experience checking in at the Mumbai airport. The airport manager was rude and would not let me check in my car seat for free which is the law in the US and demanded me to pay extra money for it. He would not listen to my argument that I got it to India for free and this was my return trip back to the US. Only later I showed him that the Air India website listed that car seats travel free that he allowed me to check the car seats for free. I would not recommend this airline to anyone till Air India retrains their staff in customer service and upgrades their airplanes.,Spicejet,2022,5
Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Vancouver,2022-07-01,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,0,2.0,"  Air India should be ashamed for operating such a dilapidated and outdated aircraft for a 14-hour flight on this sector and charging a premium of almost CAD $2500.00 per ticket for a one-way flight. Their domestic aircrafts are in much better shape. There was a 8 hour delay to begin with. Paid additional price for booking XL seats for extra leg space but to my horror realized that these seats are narrower at the waist in comparison to a normal seat. Broken tray tables with cracks and stains, no inflight entertainment (for the entire duration of the journey) and a nonworking toilet added to our woes. Would the top management of AI fly economy on such an aircraft on a 14 hour flight? The cabin crew were courteous but there was nothing much they could do with regards to the condition of the aircraft.",Spicejet,2022,7

IFE did not work for most people on the flight, meals were terrible, cabin crew took at least 15 minutes to respond to calls at a time when they were not even busy. Air con did not work for 45 minutes when we were waiting to take off at 40C in Delhi airport (it worked fine once we were airborne), seats did not recline properly.

The seats were completely uncomfortable. I had requested for 1 extra blanket for my back and they refused. The staff member said 1 person will get only one and the staff were using 3 blankets to sleep on the seats. Also they had curtains closed in the middle row. The staff occupied all the seats in the middle row to sleep.  How can the staff sleep in customer area. Business class facilities the staff were using. There is no difference in treatment of economy passengers and business class passengers. Its waste of money. Also one my luggage they had lost and it was international departure.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Paris via Delhi,2022-06-01,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,2.0,"  Thinking of an Air India flight with long stopover in Delhi? It was a horror show. Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there) If you book a hotel and organise a transit e-visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. (I had to argue to retrieve my bag tag, which was a good thing as I suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised). The delay meant I'd missed the last train, then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass. Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque since I was already checked in. No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray. No other airlines have this policy, and mine was summarily confiscated in Delhi ""you can't take things that fly on the aeroplane"" — seriously; that was their rationale! Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom was the only redeeming feature. Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian war zone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping embargos. French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between. So your legs pay a price in addition to your conscience.",Spicejet,2022,6

Nothing was done, so I just told him that I would watch a movie and let him use my screen after my movie. Midway through the flight, I was really cold, and it took me 20 minutes to call the attention of the flight attendants. The call button was not working, so I tried flashing my light from my cell phone, but nobody was minding me. Eventually, the person in the aisle seat in the same row took the initiative to inform the cabin crew to give me a blanket. Unfortunately, all blankets had already run out. The good news is that the person next to me shared his blanket with me. Also, after being served peanuts, the captain made an announcement that all passengers had to put their masks back on; however, the cabin crew was not implementing this. I have had a terrible sore throat for over a week now. I just wish Air India would take the health and comfort of the customers more seriously. In addition to this, my seat and table were not exactly very clean (see attached photos). As a Star Alliance Member, I am severely disappointed.",Spicejet,2022,7

Once we were able to board our flight after many difficulties this airline caused, we were disgusted. The mould lining the windows and the seats was unhygienic enough but the movies screen were cracked and unusable .. only very few worked and when they did they were extremely difficult to operate. We received 1 water over a 12 hour flight and the food they provided us with was mid. Flew with both my parents and a friend of mine and we requested seats together, well at least for my friend and I because we're nervous on planes. They were unable to do that for us and we all sat in completely different seats ... when we made a complaint and tried to switch seats they kept dismissing us.

Business,Business Class,London to Delhi,2022-06-01,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,0,1.0,"  Onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work, this also applies in Business Class. One might think its a fault so they'll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not. I have found this issue continuously. My negative review with Air India really relates to my lost luggage. There are no words to explain the misery i went through with Air India in trying to retrieve my bag. At Heathrow I was given a P.I.R (Property Regularity Report and a ""authority to claim delayed baggage"" form which i filled in. Alongside this I was told my bag would be back within 3-5 days and was given a online tracking link. In this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents, this is just one example. I wrote several emails to Air India and although i had responses none of them answered my question. All responses were exactly the same (standard) giving me different links. Furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered. After 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a Air India flight back to Heathrow. The bag never arrived. I only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days - basically my mornings were wasted This happened four times. It is only when i built up a decent relationship at Heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally. I called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered. When the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it - a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to Heathrow. I got to Heathrow (to get in to the baggage area is another story) and opened up my bag to find many things missing.  Thankfully some of the missing items were located (thanks to the gentleman at Heathrow who understood my situation) at Delhi airport. They advised they wouldn't post it and someone had to collect it. With the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items, however without the connections i would have had to travel to Delhi and no doubt would have been harassed. In my opinion Air India has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down. I have seen more negative reviews for Air India than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and don't ignore them but rather take them on board.",Spicejet,2022,6

Their staff members are rude and unprofessional. After flight booking I found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket, so I called customer support but its hours long wait time, then I tried US number which was picked up by a rude person who couldn't communicate in English or Hindi either, there was no resolution over the call. Before take-off safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws, cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand. Landing was very hard on touchdown. After landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt, hence we checked with Air India ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyone's luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport. The airline was managed by Indian government earlier, as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work, rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default, hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease.

I was told I can apply for a refund but when I tried, they always say we'll get back to you and no one ever does. I've been writing to them consistently for over 3 months.

First thing first was at baggage register counter was full with a lot of peoples because at the same G counter there was not just Paris flight register counter it was with Paris, New York , Toronto flight baggage counter . So there was a lot of rush it took us 2 hours to register our bags. And when we reach at counter the lady took almost 30 minutes to print our boarding passes . Then it took us 1 hours to complete the immigration process. We asked Air India employee to help us to speed up the immigration but he said we can't do anything then when we finished the security check. And ran towards our gate air India employee call us to come fast to boarding gate. We said we are coming but they did not wait for us for 5 min and can't let us in. We missed our flight. After that when i ask air India employee to help us but they were not helping us a lot.  I asked them to at least give me tickets for next flight because it was not my fault. But they said its completely your fault and we can't do anything for you. My wife was ill. she beg to your employees to at least help us in something but there was nothing from them. I asked to give us tickets for next flight but they said sir you have to pay 500€ extra for that tickets. Not a refund Not a coupon to eat something between the waiting time to get our bags. Not a single penny refunded and they are asking for 500 € We paid 500€ because we need to start our jobs. After that i asked them any help to at least a stay in hotel for waiting time but they said no we can't do anything. For me it's the first and last Air India experience. ",Spicejet,2022,4

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Vadodara via Delhi,2022-04-01,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  Before you call AI Customer service - grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process. You need to call AI customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service. Not even basic greetings. The rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly. Couple of times I asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual. Once you have your basic itinerary ready, they will transfer you to billing department which can take only AMEX or Visa card. They do have few other options like net banking, Indian credit cards etc. When you are ready to pay AI, representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment - 90% of the time that doesn't work. With that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours, so you keep on trying to pay. Then I put my Credit card information and my India address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened. My payment was accepted and here I am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company. Finally, after all this I had a ticket to travel. Before the flight I updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information. The website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again. BTW they don’t have separate line for TSA APPROVE either on the airport. It is one common line at Newark Airport (EWR). Finally, we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal. The air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a child's meal so unfortunately, we don't have an extra child's meal. I am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so I convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal. I had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck. The flight was Boeing 777 (OLD) plane which has no Wi-Fi. Everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working. The whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system. After that only 10% of the screens started working. Now on a 14 hour long flight you don't have Wi-Fi or screen. The people who already downloaded from home are very smart. In short, have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight. Finally, we made it to India and felt now everything will be fine, but my misery continued while coming back from Vadodara to Newark. As we reached Vadodara airport, all looks good, easy going, all documents verified and here I am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge. The rep is saying - Mam, all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours, so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass. Did he say had written boarding pass, I was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security won't let me pass. The AI rep is no mam, it happens sometimes, and they know. You please go ahead. As I reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass, the officer was looking at me as though I am an alien and had I issued a handwritten pass to myself. AI supposed to inform Airport security about this so I can have easy transition but knowing AI they didn't bother to inform the security. When I said firmly that it's between AI and Airport security finally AI security showed up and resolved the issue. ",Spicejet,2022,4

We reported this to the service counter for Air India in the  Delhi airport before 5pm. Approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at Delhi Airport. However, they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5. I explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldn't return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning. I even asked if I could pay to have it shipped to me in the states. She said she couldn't help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed. Then once I returned to the states there was no one working the Air India counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call. I called the Air India number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that I had to call the Delhi Service desk (the same one that wouldn’t help me when I was standing there, and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me). I told him I couldn’t afford to call Delhi and that I needed his help and he kept saying no, call the airport and then he hung up on me. We called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing. The plane was terrible, seats had no cushions and no room. None of the TVs worked and there was no WIFI ... made for a long 17hr flight. The flight crew were rude and wouldn't let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the Himalayas and I wanted to see them. When boarding Delhi to the States you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board (full xray scan and everything).

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Delhi,2022-04-01,3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,1.0,"  Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22. The scheduled stopover was 2.5 hours in which we had to complete immigration, check out baggage , go through customs and re-check in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to Bengaluru. There was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in Delhi. So we had roughly only about 1.5 hours to complete the above steps. Unfortunately, although we were able to finish all the required steps by 1:30 pm, which was the scheduled departure time, we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off. What followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller. We are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items. We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines. Travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited.",Spicejet,2022,4

Except for on-schedule flights, nothing seems to have changed under the new ownership. No entertainment system available and even the flight attendants seemed unaware. Then the lame excuse - ""our entertainment system is getting updated under new ownership"". We didn't even bother to try the entertainment system on any further leg. The Priority tags on the luggage were the biggest jokes, except at Heathrow, almost everywhere, we got our luggage almost at the end. During our return, we had a 4 hours wait at Delhi Intl. terminal and there was no lounge facility available. I would have expected them to have an arrangements with other airlines or providers.

During the 15-hour flight, none of the tv screens was working. The announcement was made over the public address system that the tv screens were faulty, for which they apologized.  AC too may not have been working because the air was humid and stuffy. None of the cabin crew came around offering water or other services.  Throughout the flight, people were walking up and down the aisle to fetch water. For lunch they also included the snack meant for tea, so crew can be spared the trouble of serving again at tea time.

No web check in from Vancouver as it is not in the drop down list.I called customer service and the poor lady could not help me much. The flight is totally basic. No inflight entertainment whatsoever. The seats are broken and dirty. No reading light or call button. Thankfully I was forewarned so I had downloaded movies for kids on their computers. I had booked seats with more leg space but despite me paying extra for this I did not get the chosen seats. This was frustrating. Nor will I get repaid for the extra fare I paid as now I dont have time to run after them. The heating system was overworking and the aircraft was boiling. When I asked staff to lower the temperature they were giving weird explanations that we are flying over north pole and temperature outside is minus 60. Finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch. The thermostat was not working. The saving grace was that most of the staff was hospitable and felt embarrassed by the poor quality aircraft themselves. They commiserated with us as they were not responsible for the poor quality provided by AI. The lady next to me helped me with my frustrated tired kids.

It’s one of the most mediocre Business classes I ever travelled in. It is more like glorified Premium Economy. Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping. Inflight Entertainment: The inflight entertainment is laughable. If you are not Indian, you will have like 10 movies to chose from. TV shows have only one episode. No music to listen to. Food: Its typical Indian food be prepared for that. Service: They server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice. You will be asked for drinks twice only. Cost: it was slightly cheaper than other business class when I say slightly 1200AUD less than other flights. And I chose it, which is clearly a mistake. Will not recommend this carrier.",Spicejet,2022,3
Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Chicago,2022-03-01,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  I have often heard of horror stories of international travel in Air India but had thankfully never had to personally experience the airline on an international route. However due to a personal emergency, I had to fly Air India recently since it was the only way I could get to Chicago in time. Air India has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey. The tortuous check-in process with agents taking upto 15-20 minutes to check-in a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in Delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board. The aircraft was run-down and shabby, which was the second warning but the best part was when I reached my seat, I had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that I could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist. Of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 4-5 seats had a working IFE system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the Air India logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway, The seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests, I have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that I never have to sit in this seat again. This was not the end of it of course, the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 2.45 am, it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in check-in and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 5-6 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible. After this the crew decided to rest for 6-7 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own tea/coffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said tea/coffee in. Perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the IFE could not. Finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard. The only redeeming factor on the flight was that Air India is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight, it did not alleviate the misery in any way. The first thing I did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way I can put myself through such an experience again.",Spicejet,2022,3

Business,Business Class,San Francisco to Delhi ,2022-02-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  I had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from San Francisco to Delhi on Feb 21st. The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. The staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states “you have 2 options, you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.”  When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger, completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. I explained my situation to the united manager, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager out of her office. She stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional ie. broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C.  Anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were broken during take off and landing. Finally the plane was filthy, the entertainment non existent and the food terrible. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery.",Spicejet,2022,2

Check-In Almost trouble free - the staff at Toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and RT-PCR test results. Staff must be trained to insert the Frequent Flyer number from other star alliance airlines. Boarding delay and nothing but chaos! There was no separate queue for business class. The counter was surrounded by passengers and the boarding was not started at the scheduled time. Smooth flight, great Boeing 777  and great meals!

Air India Lounge at Delhi airport with very little supplies and hardly any variety of food. Cramped space during the pandemic. I flew from Delhi to Mumbai after the 14 hour flight from Toronto to Delhi. It was another chaotic boarding with 1 person at the boarding point and a lot of interference by Air India non-flying crew members as they tried to get best seats for themselves and their family members having passes.

We were travelling from Mumbai to Goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 KM to Terminal 2. The flight was at 9 PM and we reached at the desk at 8.15 PM. The Air India Personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in. It was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal. Later I have checked with many passengers who informed me that the Airline Portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal. Finally, all the personnel to whoever I spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport, and made sure that I should not board in the flight. Another harassment started when I went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of Air India. The booking officer on other side of the glass/window was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made. I kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to Goa. He somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls. I asked him what is happening ? to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets. After five minutes I lost my patience and left the window. Secondly, their call centres are closed after 18:00 Hrs. A recorded message will be heard continuously after 18:00 HRs that you are in queue, but no one will respond from the other side nor the IVR facility will be available.

On the plane, when I raised the issue, the cabin crew and counter staff failed to rectify the situation. They then moved me to a demonstrably worse seat, one without a TV, which all other passengers had. Mind you, this was for a 15-hour flight. I understand that people sometimes need to have their seats shifted, but surely there were others on the plane who hadn't paid for their seats, so their seats should be changed, not those of us who paid for our seating.

Check-in and boarding were smooth. They served good food on time, however, did not serve any drinks (coffee/tea/ alcohol). It was at the back of the airlines for self-service. Cabin crews were good to help. The most disastrous incident was not working og inflight entertainment. I just can not imagine that time how to pass nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment. I would download some movies/ songs if I knew earlier. Air India does not provide inflight internet. In most of the seats, inflight entertainment system was not working. Touch screens are hardly working. On the second leg (Delhi to Kolkata), it was of approx 2hrs flight without any inflight entertainment/internet service.

I had very low expectations, and Air India was as bad as I feared. The Indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible. Every aspect of this trip was subpar, and given a choice, I cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline. Here are all the ways in which they were bad: 1) Their web site is terrible, and it wouldn't accept my Lufthansa frequent flyer number, even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers. The web site also wouldn't allow me to request a special meal, and it gave absolutely no explanation for why. From some google research, I realized this might be due to covid precautions 2) I made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues. The amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of New Delhi railway station for their calls. I could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying. They supposedly entered my Lufthansa number for me, but as I could tell when I printed my boarding pass, it wasn't entered properly, and it didn't work. I had to claim my miles via Lufthansa after the flight On a separate call, the rep took my special meal request and entered it, but didn't seem to know, or didn't bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during Covid 3) My itinerary was IAD-DEL-MAA, on different B787s for each leg. I flew business class, and the product is really sub par. The seats are grimy, the upholstery was torn on one of the legs, the seat power didn't work properly. Worst of all for me, the moving maps didn't work on both IAD-DEL and DEL-IAD legs. Also, the flat bed isn't long enough for my 6'3"" height. The pillow they give is a joke. The cabin crew were nice enough, but I really didn't like the heavy/greasy Indian food I was forced to eat on some of the legs. The food on the MAA-DEL leg even gave me severe digestion problems. 4) Air India lounges were open in DEL or MAA, supposedly due to Covid, but other private lounges were operating, so it seems like Covid was just an excuse. 5) On a couple positive notes, all my flights were on time, which was a blessing, and the prices of the business class ticket was well below pre-pandemic business class levels.",Spicejet,2021,3

This was my first time flying with this airline, and it will be the last. Both flights were delayed by hours, and no one took the time to provide any explanation as to why, or any apology for the inconvenience. The flight from Kathmandu to Delhi was delayed by 2 hours, and when it came to finally boarding the aircraft there was another security check of bags before you walked up the steps to the plane, it felt really disorganised and unusual given we had already gone through security. It almost puts doubts in your mind as if they don't trust the airports security process. When we got on the plane, the air hostess was rude and demanded I put my bag in the overhead locker despite just taking my seat and organising what I needed out of my bag. The food was not nice, and the plane was quite dirty. We were recommended this airline by a family member, I'm not sure if standards have dropped over the years, but it certainly was not up to ours given the air fare.

(1) There were no blankets supplied in most of the economy. When asked the flight attended simply said “We are sorry we ran out. When the ground crew said they only had used blankets from prior flight we refused for your safety”. (2) the in-flight entertainment system was broken and attendants simply said: “sir this is an old aircraft so many are broken - too bad”. Many “low class” customers travel in the Middle East / India sector and don’t know how to use the system and end up breaking it”. (3) food. I traveled by Air India many times and their saving grace was always good food. But this time I noticed it was super frugal (just an entree and small piece of bread ). To understand all this I struck up a conversation with one of the attendants and learned some stunning truths. He said “ sir everyone in Air India is aware of the poor quality of aircraft, non-working in-flight entertainment systems etc. but don’t seem to care. In fact, we file a detailed report after each flight, citing customer grievances, key issues etc, but nobody that can impact the situation cares. Net, it is a leadership problem. There are no customer service metrics attached to senior operational leaders’ performance evaluations and hence the outcome, As long as India government subsidies with plum jobs, customers like me can refrain from using Air India but that will not matter at all as economic forces are not at play here, For those wondering, the fare between United Airlines and Air India for this same route was almost equal (United was actually $100 cheaper and Air China was 50% lower), so Air India does not have the proverbial price advantage. I also learnt 2 new aircraft were acquired for traveling public but later converted to Air Force One for political leaders. The older aircraft if used for fare paying public. The business model is unsustainable. In new India, will someone take notice?",Spicejet,2019,11

This was the first time I was flying Air India, and I have truly never used a worse mode of transportation ever. Air India has the worst aircraft with the most ancient entertainment systems. But that is a mere inconvenience in the harrowing experience that Air India considers to be an acceptable journey. After missing my connecting flight at Delhi International Airport, thanks to the inefficient airport security, and spending the night at the airport, when it was time to check-in to my new connecting flight, the Air India personnel at the counters were extremely curt, unhelpful and uncooperative about checking in my luggage that was already cleared from my previous flight. Upon boarding my next flight, I was welcomed to an unclean seat and food tray. Once I finally landed at my intended destination, Air India managed to lose one of my checked bags, which I was reconciled with after 6 days.

We chose them because they were offering the best times for both trips (but they changed them later from 8.40 in the morning to 2.40 in the middle of the night - and they do this apparently regularly). On both flights (actually all 4 flights because there is a stop over in Delhi) the online check-in was not working - as a result my family of four were spread all over the plane. In one case they booked as in row 23, but the aircraft only has 21 rows. So their IT is simply not working, everything is utmost slow (it took us 20 minutes to check in at the desk in Colombo). The aircraft from Colombo to Delhi is really old and dirty and this in combination with a non working IT, you don't believe that they really care about technical standards and safety. The entertainment system didn't work on both flights from FFM to Delhi. Every passenger needed numerous resets to get the minimum going - the minimum means a really small collection of outdated movies. I think even 15 years ago other airlines had better entertainment systems. This is clearly not acceptable. Sleeping was also difficult because we had numerious kids crying on all flights. The only positive aspect: some of the staff (not all) tried to do their best to solve the problems. So at least for us: never Air India again no matter how good their flight times are or how cheap they are. It is a shame that they are a member of the Star Alliance group.",Spicejet,2019,8

The cabin only has 18 comfortable seats which make excellent beds at the press of a control. The layout is 2x2x22 so you could be unlucky if travelling alone as not much privacy.

The staff were rude to us and the the tray table was filthy and had bits of dried up food stuck on it, when I reported this to the stuff they handed me a tissue asked me to it clean up. You could have at least cleaned up the aircraft for the passengers to use and I take this offensive because hygiene is important to me. Next when we reached Delhi we were told to collect our luggage from the luggage belt and load it on to the next flight because it was a domestic one, this was the first ever time any airline had asked us to collect our luggage when we hadn't even reached our destination. At first we weren't sure because we had flown before and this had never happened so I asked the people at the information desk for help, there wasn't anyone else there but for some apparent reason the people at the desk couldn't see me I said excuse me about three times before someone looked up from their phone and when they did they were unhelpful and they looked at me like how could I disturb them from they're phone's.

Unfortunately, it ended up being Air India. I flew from Denver to Washington on United (Code Share) and then Washington to Delhi on Air India. The flight was delayed by a couple hours. Also, the boarding process was a mess. I stood in the line for like 45 min and then they asked me to get a new boarding pass when I was just about to get in, then put me back at the end of the line! I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi. So, I had to file a delayed baggage claim. The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn't enough staff available to help. Nobody knew what information to provide. After struggling for a couple hours, they filed a delayed baggage report and they told me I'd be receiving my bag within a couple days. After a couple of days, I called them and they told me that they didn't know where the bag was. So, I started calling them everyday. It would take me a couple hours of calling before they would pick up the phone. The phone operators never had any information about what was going on. One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore!!! I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report. But they never responded! After 10 days, I received a call from a local airport. They told me to come pick up the bag. I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home. As I had a family emergency at home, there was no way I could travel a couple hours to the airport to pick up my bag. So , I told them that I would be filing a police report for stolen bag if they didn't deliver my bag. After several hours, they called me to let me know that they are sending the bag with someone to my home. On Air India's website, it is mentioned that there is $50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours. I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation, but no one responds. I have been sending them emails every day without any luck.

Due to the short length of the runway at Mumbai airport and incompatibility of Air India, they always remove passenger baggage without ever informing them. They use a very common excuse ""bad weather"". So don't be surprised if you realize at your destination that your baggage was removed and never arrived with you. All other airlines are perfectly fine to land and take off from the Mumbai airport and you never hear any excuses from them. After realizing that you and several other passengers reached their destination without your baggage, the real fun (or frustration) begins. You will realize that Air India has only one phone number for their customer service contact which is the real deal. Average wait time to talk to a representative is over 60 min based on online search (I'm not exaggerating, in my personal experience these were the timings: 96 min, 118 min, 72 min and 130 min). Well after these wait times, you'll end up talking to the most idiotic morons on this planet who probably hate the entire human race. They no idea about anything related to Air India and no respect to listen to what you want, let alone help you. The frustration continues as these reps have no connection to the baggage department and then ask us to get a mystical ""complain number"" before they can look into our case. After calling the customer care for the fourth time, I was told that the number for US baggage department (973-242-0078). Now, I called them over 10-15 times over a period of two days and no one picks up the phone. The fun part is their voicemail box is full and not surprisingly you cannot leave any message or ever get that mystical ""complaint number"". Wrote emails to all departments of Air India including the baggage department. Still waiting for a reply. It's been three days and I'm looking for the lost baggage for me and my parents who travelled to the US and sill have no response from Air India.

No one had cleaned after the previous flight. 3) No inflight entertainment. Everything was broken. 4) Calling the hostess is a useless exercise. Don’t bother waiting. 5) The arm rests were broken and cracked dangerously enough to cause a hazard for little kids. They kept falling on them when they were trying to sleep. 6) They have nothing to offer little kids. No coloring sheets, stickers. Nope. 7) Had booked child meals and was never offered the option while serving.

I was traveling with my son and to make it easier instead of 2 suitcases of 23kg each I chose to carry 1 suitcase of around 28kg. While going to Paris I travelled in Emirates with same luggage allowance and had smoothest check-in. But for my return flight they did not let me check in because I had one suitcase and asked me to either make it in two bags (which  I didn’t have on Paris airport) or pay for excess. Even on requesting and telling them I have 46kg combined allowance for both tickets on same PNR but they denied stating I have to pay if I am beyond 23kg or I need to find my solutions and come back to them for checking. The air hostesses in flight were least interested in service. The headphone of my seat and my neighbours weren’t working and even after multiple requests they never even for once got time in a 9 hour flight to change our headset and thus no entertainment for us. Our flight from Paris to Delhi gets delayed. After customs and immigration the luggage drop off counter is a small crowded counter. No proper queues and Officers are the most rude people you will encounter. They at the last moment before dropping our luggage asked us to check in the liquor bought on duty free. We had to take out clothes from our bag and put bottles inside on the counter which was badly crowded and unprofessionally managed. Upon arrival in Mumbai after almost 15-18 hours and waiting for almost 40 mins for our luggage we are told that our baggage is left in Delhi and will come in the evening flight and will be delivered only after 1:00Am. On telling them that this delivery time is not acceptable they day they can only deliver that time or next day but when we told them there wont be anyone at home as we will be at office. The executive there told me that its my problem not hers. In all this was the worst experience in terms of an airline I can ever had. ,Spicejet,2019,6

When I reached New Delhi, I was told that they do not have any hotel but can provide me with lounge access which has beds to sleep and fresh up. I was provided with a complimentary dinner from Dilli Street restaurant inside the domestic terminal. But when I came to lounge to take rest I was told that there is communication for them to provide lounge access and we had to escalate this to a manager at New Delhi airport who in turn told me that they did not promise me any lounge access or beds. I was told to just stay at boarding gate.  This is my first time flying with Air India. When I mentioned the same with Air India agents they said that this always happens with Air India and the service is not that great with Air India. When I spoke with manager and asked them ""Shouldn't they be providing accommodation for delays from Air India and is this how you treat passengers?"" Her reply was you can interpret that in any way but I cannot help you in any way except for asking you to wait at departure gate.

The only slight drawback was the check-in procedure (that was not flight-specific but for all AI flights) and that took about 1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting to get four lines of passengers checked in before me, although these were the 'drop-bag' check in counters.

I had my retrun flight from Delhi on April 29th 2019.

She was accompanied with what seems to be the manager. The agent ignored me completely and focused only on the new customer with many passports. I asked for explanations many times but the only answer I got is ""one second madam"". After about 10min, when finished with the ""out of nowhere"" customer, he handed me back my passport while telling me that my flight is tomorrow. The only explanation I got is that there was a technical problem with the company's server and there were not enough seats. After getting my boarding card for tomorow's flight I went to Air India's agency to demand an accommodation or any other assistance while waiting for my flight the next day. The only answer I've got is that there is nothing I can get on the spot and all I can do is to send a complaint by email to ask for compensation. If possible, avoid Air India at all cost.

Male security persons were opening ladies purses and searching them so disrespectfully. When I asked what's this checking for, I was not given any answers. The body check was also done in the most disrespectful way and everyone was feeling frustrated. When we finally came onboard, none of the staff or the captain apologised for the almost 2 hrs delay.

The chicken came with rice and vegetables with a separate side salad and desert, all of which was tasty and of good quality. On top of this there were two drink-runs and before landing they provided another sandwich. The seat was good (admittedly I forked out for an exit row which I then was happily able to have the whole row to myself), legroom good enough for a giraffe. The only very minor minus points were the not-working global map and a rather limited selection of new films. The crew was responsive and courteous and happy to assist.

I'm a multi-million miler, and I'd be hard pressed to think of a worse experience than 15 hours on Air India. Not all of it is the airline's fault--but if you connect from a domestic flight to leave from Delhi, you go through seven different ID and security checks before getting on the plane: everything from accessing the terminal to accessing the gate, each has its own separate security inspection. I'm not sure what terrible people they believe would pose a threat to an airline which needs no help falling apart. At the gate. We were delayed several hours for reasons unknown and unexplained. When we did board, there was immense disappointment. The seat cushion at my seat was clearly from a regional aircraft and did not fit the seat, It covered maybe 75% of the seat area, and the rest of me was sitting on the gap or directly on the metal seat frame. The entertainment system was non-functional. A 15 hour flight, and it was broken. But whatever, it's 4AM and we've been waiting almost four hours to leave. It's time to push back. And we're back to the gate. At least the pilot checked to see if we had fuel before taking off. Because apparently we didn't have enough. And refueling took another 40 minutes. That hardly seems like a top up because we idled the engines for too long. And now we're finally on our way. The food served was...pretty dreadful. The cabin crew did their best, but the condition of the aircraft wasn't their fault. However, the cleanliness of the aircraft was indeed their responsibility. By midflight, all but one lavatory had run out of toilet paper and paper towels. The one lavatory which hadn't run out of paper had an actual hole punched in the bottom of the toilet, and was covered in human waste as it could no longer flush. It was probably the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen, and even worse, there were no alternatives--waiting another 6 hours wouldn't end well for me. The ironic thing is that the inflight maps show the locations of famous shipwrecks as you fly over them--which serves as a reminder that there are some journeys that actually are worse than flying Air India. Change here needs to start from the top, and run through this organization like an avalanche. They'll need years of good reviews and quality results before I'd consider them again, but I don't think they'll have that luxury.",Spicejet,2019,2

At my seat the IFE was not working but it was not of any real consequence as I had planned on maximizing my sleep / rest time onboard. There were 3 hot meals provided on this sector with refreshments / dinner / breakfast provided. As there were some seats vacant I was able to slip back to those seats, stretch out and take good rest for 3-4 hours which was a huge advantage as I was feeling really fresh upon arrival which was 15 minutes ahead of schedule.

What a way to celebrate the international womens day than spend 5 hours with mom at the Delhi customs office, where we literally left close to midnight. This is after completing a 12 hour journey from Sydney on a flight with Air India. On the day that Air India was boasting about having an all women crew on all flights originating from India, My mother and I were struggling dealing with the rash, unprofessional and unethical officials at the AI office. This was my first and last experience with Air India My only reason to opt for this airline was because Air India is the only flight that was flying direct, allowing me and my pet to travel together. There were a lot things that went down that day, that showed lack to professionalism, ethics, corruption and misconduct. Firstly, my pet exporting company did not get a response from Air India till less than 24 hrs of travel , despite submitting all documentation more than a week ago . Secondly , I was waiting at the airport for least 40 mins as per the advice of the baggage team for my pets collection. After constantly nagging them for more Information, they told me to collect the cat from the cargo area without any directions provided to locate of the building. The Air India cargo group and customs office had absolutely no idea on how to deal with the import of a pet . There was a very obvious lack of training , and lack of knowledge of the process and protocol . All I saw was chaos and officials palming us off from one dept to another. Thirdly , air india mucked me around for another 2 hours before actually sending me to the right dept, all I heard throughout my discussion with them was whether I have an agent as they mostly deal with agents. I assume these are the middle men who get the job done. I told them there is no need for these as ACQS India has a well defined protocol that they should be following , to which that had absolutely no response apart from ""I should hire an agent. "" The middle men in India will follow the same process as what I did, the only difference would be some extra cash they slip in the pockets of these officials, who did not seem to want to do the job. I was also told that the server was down for maintenance that day, and the money has to be transferred online and only using the net bank of public banks such as PNB. The customs kept repeating that the Air India was not responding . However when my mom reached her threshold at 10. 30 pm and lashed out at the entire dept creating a a scene, the job was done within 15 mins. Air India was responding , the server was working and the money was collected in cash. We were given the gate pass to collect our cat and mom and I finally left the premises at 11 pm at night. This was my warm welcome back to my country. I can only imagine the loops they make foreign citizens go through. Finally, Air India has a vigilance dept, which provides a phone no. to report such misconduct and malpractices. As expected the number does not work.

The flight attendant was extremely rude to me and would not serve me. I have never been treated so badly on a flight before- it actually made me sick to my stomach. I asked for a glass of wine and he denied me. He told me to “not treat him that way”. I pay money for this service, and to be treated as if I am a second class citizen. I will never ride Air India ever again. There is a group of men next to me who are being extremely loud and the fight attendants are no doing nothing about it. They are making kissing sounds at me, yet when I tell the flight attendants they tell me to just ignore it. I expect to be treated with respect when I’m on a flight, and am truly disgusted that you hire flight attendants like this who treat people like second class citizen.

Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Chennai via Delhi,2019-02-01,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  
San Francisco to Chennai via Delhi. This is the worst international airline I have taken ever.  The flight from SFO to Delhi departed 40 minutes past the scheduled time. When it was 30 minutes past the scheduled departure time, the captain informed us of the delay due to some reasons. I wondered what stopped him from informing us of this earlier. They have the worst in-flight service. Most of the IFE screens are malfunctioned. Some didn't work at all. The selection of movies, shows etc. were so limited and mostly outdated. The screen resolution would remind of 90s experience. There is no organization shown by the in-flight crew. Some snippets from the plane - People would stand by their seat for an hour or so every few hours ; couple guys would stand in the pathway , chatting for 30-40 minutes. Not to mention that it created so much inconvenience for fellow passengers to go to restrooms ; group of 3-4 guys would stand by the kitchen and restrooms for couple hours and chat casually. Surprisingly, I saw couple crew members joining them as well ; Some people in their seat would never stop chatting , though it was late night. The entire thing felt like a typical Indian fish market. I had a connecting flight with Air India to Chennai. Since the SFO flight was running late, I inquired with the crew members about the connecting flight status. Some said it won't wait for us and some said it would. After we landed in Delhi an hour past the scheduled time, I ran towards the connecting flight gate. The flight was still there but I wasn't allowed to board it. I had 3 other folks who were going to Chennai. We were put in another flight that left 3.5 hours later. Of course, the drama didn't end yet. This flight was scheduled to leave at 7.55 pm IST. It was 8.15 pm and there was no announcement on the status. There were two AI staff members at the counters. After I inquired about the status , they made an announcement for the ongoing delay. We boarded the flight 45 minutes past the scheduled time. While we were getting off the plane at Chennai, one of crew members falsely accused a passenger of keeping his carry-on bag in the restricted overhead compartment. Most of us saw a crew member putting it there since we ran out of space. So unprofessional. My return flight from Delhi to SFO saw another hiccup. This time they delayed the flight because 7 passengers couldn't come on time due to a delay in arrival from Mumbai AI flight. Remember how I missed the domestic flight earlier and I was told that 300 passengers couldn't wait so they had to leave without us. But they could delay the international flight for a delayed domestic flight. Such theatrics could only be seen with them. This is the first in my experience. They let down us again with horrible food (no seasoning and bland). Refreshments were barely edible. I would say it was the worst food offered on an international plane. ",Spicejet,2019,2

We left Goa almost 2 hours late after scheduled time. We were told that we wouldn't lose the connection because the plane that we were going to fly from Goa would stop in Mumbai, get new passengers and continue direct to Delhi. When we arrived to Mumbai we were surprised as they told us to go out, together with another passengers to the counter E and check in again. We already had checked in back in Goa. We were running all the way through the airport to the counter. They changed our tickets and surprise! We run back again to find out that we went back onto the same plane. We left Mumbai delayed, probably because of so many passengers running around the airport. Later, staff told us that the plane in Delhi to Copenhagen was going to wait for us because we were around 10-15 people going on the next flight. The plane to CPH was supposed to leave at 14 and we landed in Delhi at 13:35. When we came out from the plane there was an operator waiting for us to guide us fast through security checks etc. to the other plane which was waiting for us. We went all together and the surprise was that everyone boarded and we were refused. They told us that our names were deleted from the passengers list. The staff could not tell us what happened or why did it happen, claiming that it must had been in Mumbai where they thought that we won't make it on the CPH plane. We looked at the plane from departure gate, leaving the hub at 14:43. That is when the nightmare started. The staff at the gate told us that our bags haven't even arrived from Mumbai due to the fact that we were deleted on the list. We spend 8 hours at the airport trying to solve our problem. Air India staff were rude when we asked for what happened, lazy to answer our questions lacked of professionalism. From the staff from the gate (4 people), we were pushed to another group of staff, then another staff and so on. They didn't admit the mistake they have made moreover, they claimed that we were late for the plane and that's why we lost it. We were fighting with everyone trying to get the true and they were sugarcoating us all the time. We were not the only ones at the airport with similar situation to ours. They even didn't want to give us hotel to spend the night. After fighting a lot they gave us a really bad and disgusting Hotel. During all day we were with no food and no water. Additionally, our bags went missing so we had no clothes to change or any hygiene appliances with us.We had a very bad ending of our holidays because of Air India's staff incompetence.

Upgrading is a waste as the planes are so old and dirty that you aren't getting anything by upgrading. You could not pay me to fly them, it was that bad! They also weigh your carry on luggage.

We were told our flight is cancelled and aircraft never even left Delhi. After hustle we we provided with very nice SriLanka Air flight leaving Male at 8:45 PM! But that time we already spent 12 hours in airport. With one stop we reached Bangalore at 3:30 AM! That made 18 hours trip from Male to Bangalore, instead of 2.

We will never fly this airline again. My husband got sick during our trip and was hospitalized. We needed to change our return flight due to this ordeal, and Air India was a horror to deal with in the midst of this terrible experience. Most international airlines waive Date Change fees when health emergencies are concerned - but Air India charges the max of $300, and ripped us off for the fare difference as well, although we were changing our flight from a peak week to a much less busy travel week.

Transfer - only had 1 hour on the outward journey which meant a frantic rush to transfer - Delhi airport is rather old and the staff are slow. Leg room - pretty good. Cleanliness - bad.

This was my first time in AI business class, I was traveling at very short notice due to a family medical emergency and AI had the cheapest fare $3400 RT. My collection of experiences reaffirms why this airline which had its heyday in the 70s and 80s is now the laughing stock of the airline industry. The staff's attitude is unmotivated and their approach lacks professionalism - they kept trying to take away my food and drink when i clearly hadn't finished, and otherwise wouldn't clear items when i had finished for a while. The chief purser only stayed in the 1st class section and never came out once to introduce himself or spend any time in the biz class section. The tray table hinge was broken (both ways of the roundtrip) which meant it was pressing against my thigh and couldn't be moved front/back. And the seat controls are atrociously bad - its hard to figure out which way its actually moving and the grating jerky movements make for a poor customer experience. The meals served was mostly lukewarm or cold and the staff didn't seem to care. If this is the experience in business class, i really dread to think what the economy class must be like. Clearly the airline strategy is to compete on price, not quality of service. And the final straw is that i got an email today asking for feedback - when i provided it and try to submit i got a response (please note the spellings) ""Server Error Please Try Later Sorry for Inconvinence casued to you. Team Air-India"". This is an unbelievably poor airline that is being badly managed and run for years.

The interior looked rather deteriorated and service was shoddy. The tv was held together with masking tape, and you gotta hold it up yourself! The remote control had no buttons, basically useless, the touch screen was barely working and the remote was dirty. The chair was rough and it snagged my stocking. For each leg of my trip I had to call crew assistance once, and none came until the food was served. Only spicy food was available. Barely any crew service on the 7-hour flight, but on the 3-hour flight they offered refreshments occasionally. I got allergic contact dermatitis on my hands from the soap in the bathroom and I've only had an incident once before, from paint, so there is something very strong in their soap... so I couldn't wash my hands in flight (bags were transferred by the airline so didn't have the chance to get my own soap for the 2nd leg of the flight). Luckily, they had medicine but of course I had to go to their area for help and endure my burning hands, the crew were talking to each other that I had to say ""excuse me"", it almost felt like I was bothering them. They looked at my hands (there were no visible sores, it was just a bit red but it hurt so much) and they took their time. The 2nd leg of the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours, no proper notification and in possibly the worst airport ever. I want to sound impartial but there are really no better words. This is the first time I've flown with them and I can't recommend. I've traveled on LCC many times and not one experience was as unfortunate as this.

Air India supervisors, who had no competence, leadership, organization, or plans were found to have lied to the passengers once one of the younger employees admitted they knew all along the flight was not coming. These supervisors engaged in a 3 hour argument with these 60 or so passengers and at the end offered nothing to the passengers at all.

The meal was not too bad, but unlike other airlines, the whole thing, including dessert is served on one crowded tray. The promised choice of desserts and chocolates never appeared. This is not a deal breaker, but just a bit surprising given the number of staff and the limited number of seats in business class. I think where Air India falls down is in its décor. Even though this was a fairly new Boeing 787, it looked tattered and worn. The colors, light tan and sad red, give it a dingy look.

However, this time, we had to pay for our tickets again. Air India was simply cheating us by making a huge deal out of a small mistake that they themselves have made with our tickets. We had to pay double the amount for our tickets only to recieve the same treatment and service. I would rate Air India zero stars if I could.

Traveling for first time with Air India on international sector and I think this is the worst of all flights i have taken internationally. Unfriendliness of staff is  seen even before the flight has taken off. On top, they seem so rude. I am traveling with a 6yo and every other flight I have taken so far with my son (Delta, Air France, unites, Lufthansa, American Airlines) have been so friendly and helpful but it’s a different story here. Plus the flight seems so uncomfortable. It’s so hot, on asking they have been asking to wait since half an hour now. My son has asked for water 3 Times now but alas no one is listening us. Hating it already, plus now they announce technical issue in flight. Never ever again am I flying in air India. ",Spicejet,2018,7

Air India offered the worst possible service on the return flight. It all started when airline agent didn't check the baggage through to the final destination and I had to pick up the entire lot (6 bags) plus 2 hand luggage, baby changing bag and the laptop bag also while handling a toddler. Add to that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours from Delhi to Birmingham and the onward flight from Birmingham to Belfast missed. Had to wait for several hours before some lady with half information and no patience booked a hotel for us to stay overnight and booked the next flight at 18.45 next day (even when there were 3 other flights from the same airline available at earlier times). Add to this, we were kicked out of the hotel by 12:00 forcing us to go to the airport 7 hours earlier and spend time with a toddler till the flight came. Flight was delayed by 25 min...(fortunately it didn't get cancelled) and we reached our destination 24 hours later than planned.

My wife and I booked a flight from Munich to Goa via Frankfurt and Delhi in Business Class, then after some days from Goa to Kathmandu via Mumbai and the return from Kathmandu to Munich. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt was operated by Lufthansa, the other flights were operated by Air India. The booking was in one ticket. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt with Lufthansa was nice. When it was time for boarding in Frankfurt, Air India could not open the ticket. After a lengthy discussion we were finally allowed to board the aircraft (without boarding passes), which already had some 45 minutes delay due to our issue. Our seats that we reserved months ago were given to other passengers so we had separate seats. The business class seat actually is okay and so was the onboard service. The seat just looked dirty and used. Air India uses a new 787 on this route but they look like old 767 that have been in service for the past 20 years. After all, we were just too frustrated to enjoy them. Once in Delhi, an agent picked us up and escorted us to the gate for our connecting flight which we boarded without a boarding pass. While the Air India representatives in Frankfurt organized that we arrive at our destination, they did not think about our Air India flight from Goa to Kathmandu. Long story short: The agents in Goa could not find the ticket and we booked a new flight to Mumbai in Economy Class. The agents in Mumbai could see the ticket but since we did not use the portion from Goa to Mumbai the ticket was now invalid…and we bought another Ticket from Mumbai to Kathmandu. (By now the ticket was refunded and we received a compensation. But that was a long way.) Verdict: I had quite a few other flights with Air India last year and there is always something that does not work. It is part of the adventure of travelling to India I guess, but in the future I will try to avoid Air India. It is just not a good airline.",Spicejet,2017,10

They did not care to offer even a light snack or a sandwich. for nine hours and this was in the Business Class, we do not know what they did in the Economy Class. When asked the staff about this, we were told that they are suppose to serve only two meals in such a long flight. We can understand you serve two major meals but how about some snacks etc. in nine hours. It would have been fine but since I am a diabetic and need to eat some thing on regular intervals. But sorry that is the only food service they offer. Wanted to talk to the Supervisor about it and was told the supervisor would come to talk to you but of course nobody came to talk to us at all until we landed in New Delhi as if you simply do not care and if you are diabetic then it is your problem. We have flown in Business Class on so many different airlines around the world and have never experienced such a poor food service. Have you ever compared your business class service with other airlines? How can you compete with them with this kind of service? They serve food, drinks and snacks throughout the flight in Business Class without even asking. No wonder Air India is losing money. Who would like to pay this kind of money for Business Class and get this kind of service. It is surprising, at one time Air India was known for it's food service.

Both initial departure flights on separate days were delayed, conveniently resulting in my unexpected ""royal"" transit treatment in New Delhi! On my way to Colombo, the Delhi transit desk staff blankly told us that we had missed our connecting flight and simply would not board me on the next Sri Lankan Air with the excuse that this was a split ticket. Instead a staff member gave me a few numbers to call for the issuance of a new boarding pass. Eventually advising me it's best to purchase a new ticket as I was pressed for time. He even handed me a 'delay certificate' (w annotation at the bottom ""We thank you for flying Air India and wish you a happy journey) that could be used as proof in the event I would like to be reimbursed for the new ticket purchased! Ultimately, I was stuck at the Delhi transit desk for 5+ hours (along with other angry customers), even after paying out of my pocket for a new connecting ticket as I was made to endlessly for the issuance of a new boarding pass.

The flight attendant that was serving the right hand side of the economy row facing the plane was a mere piece of cattle that was being forced to work against her will, well at least that’s the impression that me and my family members got along with others on that section. My sister was given a seat with no onboard entertainment for a flight that lasted approximately 8 hours. She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row “be careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replace”. Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break. These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome. A demand for change of seats was declined too. The concept of customer service is a mere myth to this establishment. If you value your custom and value for money my strong recommendation is seek alternative airlines and stay away from this airline. I regret flying with Air India and will never do so in the future.

At least 8-10 entertainment systems are broken in the flight and the attendants don’t care or do anything other than saying sorry sir this seat entertainment is broken. Despite being an Indian airline the food they serve is so horrible - it’s just unbelievable. So many other international airlines serve 10x better food.

I had similar problems on the flight back. Many of the passengers on both flights appeared to have inflight entertainment systems which were non functional or dysfunctional and the Air India entertainment system in general appears to be by far the most user unfriendly system I have ever encountered of any airline. This represents a major inconvenience on lung haul flights which are up to 15 hours in length. The Boeing 777s of Air India do not seem to be well maintained at all.

He told me that it is against their policy to record video which I was not aware of. Still, I apologised. Nevertheless, the plane was amazing. The economy window seat which I got had plenty of leg room and great seat incline and massage options. Most importantly, the infotainment system of the aircraft was amazing. I enjoyed that a lot.

We were given a reasonable lunch meal soon after take off, the cabin crew came round once during the nearly 10 hour flight with water and our pre early evening landing snack of a roll was so cold as to be almost frozen. During the flight our ""seat belt"" lights came on a few times due to turbulence but this did not disturb the crew who stayed inside their curtained off galley areas and never came out to check that everyone had buckled up. When we were landing, no one came around to check that seat backs were in the upright position (and therefore many were not) nor to check that people had buckled in. The cabin crew member who was a few feet away from me and in charge of an emergency exit, closed his eyes and went to sleep for about 20 minutes whilst we were landing. I suspect he was assuming that if we crashed on landing, the jolt would wake him up ! Does anyone in Air India care about the poor performance of their economy class cabin crew?

The screen on my first flight was broken therefore I had no entertainment for the first flight, and on the second flight my partners remote didn't work on his screen. Both times we let the staff know to which they didn't do much about or even seem to care. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with. ",Spicejet,2018,1

When we initially checked in for our flight in Chicago to our departure in Ahmedabad. The policies they state on their website do not correlate what the company actually adheres to i.e baggage policy. During the flight they have the worst customer service. I waited over 20 minutes for an air hostess after pressing the button and when I asked for water when they had a chance I was scowled at and not to mention they never even brought the water. Overall I would never recommend this airline to anyone flying. ,Spicejet,2018,1
Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Delhi,2018-01-01,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,0,7.0,"  London to Delhi. Air India receives very few positive reviews and very many negative reviews - unfortunately this review is one of the latter ones. Our plane was quite new, possibly less than half full so we had plenty of room to stretch out, change seats etc. We took off on time and landed only a few minutes late due to stacking over Delhi. Eventually the inflight entertainment system worked after a couple of reboots although I would have to say that the choice of films was one of the poorest I have encountered on modern planes. So what was wrong? What seems to be the usual I am afraid with Air India - the flight staff who did only the very barest minimum during the flight and hid away the rest of the time doing nothing other than talking to each other. We were served a non alcoholic drink shortly after take off immediately followed by breakfast. Some people later had their trays collected, others did not. Five hours later the crew appeared again, served a non alcoholic drink and dinner (mine was barely warm and had to be rejected). Trays were collected and that was all we ever saw of them. If you wanted any in-flight water you had to go and search it out because no one ever came around the cabin offering anything. There were no inflight announcements about journey duration, route, weather, delay on landing. Four airlines fly London Delhi direct (BA, Jet, Virgin and Air India). I have flown with them all and whilst the Air India plane was the most comfortable and its day time flight timings the most convenient, the service was the worst. I suspect that no one in the airline really cares about receiving poor reviews, wouldn't it be nice if some one did?",Spicejet,2018,1

I have taken this flight twice now and both have been the worst travel experiences of my life. I have never complained with any other airline but the staff this airline hires are so rude all the time. Being the largest Indian airline you would expect them to be hospitable, instead they are just the opposite. The staff actually laughed at my face today on a request made by me. I would suggest everyone to take any airline but this one. It’s only negative vibes and your entire travel experience is ruined.It’s only negative vibes ",Spicejet,2018,1

They lost my bags at the Mumbai Airport, which is another terribly run organization and should be avoided at all costs. My bags have now been missing over 72 hours. They open a case through their Airport baggage organization, which is contracted to help Air India with lost baggage claims. It also allows Air India to evade responsibility and accountability. If you try to contact Air India customer service to discuss compensation / details of your lost bag, they tell you they can't help. They direct you to Bangkok. Bangkok gives you the Air India policy and tells you it's completely non-negotiable. They say they don't have the power to do anything, any changes must be done by Air India, and they direct you to call Air India. This allows Air India to completely evade any negotiation or accountability. So far as a business class passenger with no bags for 72 hours+ I've been given a paltry 50 pounds, about 65 USD at the time of posting. Should be enough to buy a decent pair of pants. If this company wants to call itself a premier airline, they need to go back to elementary school for customer service. I've heard that the Mumbai airport which they base out of has a huge issue with lost baggage. Save yourself the nightmare of losing your bags overseas. Avoid this joke of an airline.

Aircraft was not as clean, seats were dirty and some of the armrests quite loose. Cabin crew attitude and their behaviour with passengers  leaves much to be desired. On three occasions they served drinks or food coming from behind rather from front, no eye contact, no smile, nothing. In the first serving they gave options of non-veg/veg/continental food but in the second serving only option was Indian food which was too spicy to be eaten by a person living in Europe. I went to the galley area to have some water/juice and had a small conversation with the crew, while I was standing they remain seated on their seats without showing simple courtesy of leaving their seat, stand up and have conversation, galley area lights were too dim to see anything and on one occasion I found all lights switched off (total darkness). They did not bother to check toilets, if there are toilet seat covers, tissue papers are available or not. Simply said, I don’t care attitude runs in their blood.

Staff were really nice looked after the people in business class and offered drinks and food. After take off, food was served and the food was really tasty. Only thing that bothered me was that Air India doesn't serve alcohol in the domestic sector. Layover in Delhi was good and efficient, and soon we were ready for take off.

I always had a good opinion about Air India international flights in-spite of several inputs from family and friends not to fly Air India, however I experienced this during my recent travel. The crew were extremely impolite and not hospitable. They refused to serve non-veg when asked for. They asked me to weigh the baggage at a counter and at that point of time it was well within the baggage allowance, however at the point of check in the baggage showed an excess and I was charged a $100 dollars unnecessarily as penalty. To double check this I weighed the baggage as soon as I got home and found it was just 0.5 kg in excess. The entertainment unit is the only source of entertainment on a long flight however in spite of repeated requests to the crew of a dysfunctional monitor nobody bothered to rectify it.

No WiFi service on board. In-flight entertainment was limited. I'm a gold level flier and this was my worst flight experience. I reclined my seat and it failed to return to a seated position about 5 hours into a flight. After messing with the seat for 15 minutes, the flight attendant put me in another seat - only to find out that that seat did not recline at all. 15 minutes later, a discussion with the purser, I was switched with another passenger and found his dirty socks in my seat.

Currently reeling under the situation of being sold off privately, the airline seems to be in splits as far as operations go. And my dissatisfaction started right from the check in kiosk itself, with the representative not from AI, but from a contract with the DIAL corp. The attitude this representative was showing unnecessarily was very upsetting. Boarded the flight with a half-hearted Namaskar from the flight attendant, something I was not expecting as AI FA's used to be the pride of the airline and a great first impression with their onboard greetings. This half hearted attitude stayed throughout the entire crew faculty present onboard the flight. No proper training given either; the methods used by the FA's to receive and give drinks was extremely clumsy as well as the attitude with which flight information was given. Food was also mediocre, not so special, but appreciated. No complaints from the flight timing, took off and landed before time! The aircraft however was extremely old, no personal IFE screen and the seats were not as comfy, not to mention dirty. While deboarding, the attitude of get-off-the-plane-already was present. Completely ruined even the last impression of the flight. Overall I do not encourage travellers to board AI, they don't seem to take customer reviews and feedback seriously to improve service. Price wise flight was great though and timing was efficient, being one of the first flights to leave the capital for KTM.

The cabins were grubby, I had to ask numerous times for a cloth to wipe my area and screen as there were finger marks of old food still on the screen. We felt that the crews on all the legs were all quite surly and really did not want to be there and anything was a bit too much of a bother. Once the meal service was done they all huddled in the galley and sat and read. On the transit at Delhi the ground staff were not much better at the customer service experience either, we were met with rude agents barking orders where to go as we had not heard an announcement due to having queued in security for an hour.

I have a large family and the cabin crew were unhelpful to say the least. The food (curry) is unsuitable for small children and they did not have a children's menu (apparently this is available but you need to request in advance, something which we were not told at the time of booking despite entering the ages of the children). Even if those are their rules, the cabin staff could have tried to help (eg with extra bread or a snack) rather than leave small children on a 10 hour flight with no food. The staff were clearly not accustomed to dealing with children and were constantly complaining when they dropped stuff (blankets, wrapping) on the floor (as kids do). One passenger had to tell them to stop scolding his 2 year old as that was his job not theirs (the kid was very well behaved). The flight from Delhi to Madrid was almost 10 hours and the staff basically served food, cleared up and then did nothing until about 90 minutes before landing when they served a very small snack. Anyone who needed anything had to go look for it themselves. On the flight to Delhi I left my Kindle ebook in the seat pocket. Given we were in the last row I fully expected the cabin staff to recover it when they checked the plane on landing. However, 4 weeks on I still don't know. The email for lost luggage doesnt work so I had to contact the airline and was given 2 alternatives. I have since sent a number of reminders but have had no response (the emails have been read). I guess they don't care too much about custom.",Spicejet,2017,7

Since advertising the Boeing 787 as their flagship plane I was looking forward to flying the aircraft for the first time. However to my surprise it was probably one of the dirtiest aircraft I have been on. Airvents had so much dust accumulated that the vents had turned black. Broken trays.  In my experience the airline had good punctuality in this flight however I would be cautious if booking with them to check for delay patterns. Staff are somewhat helpful however not very welcoming or engaging. Felt they were really there just to dish out the food. Did not get a single response from any stewardess on the aircraft on all occasions of travel when using the assistance button in seat. Inflight entertaintment is probably one of the worst. If you are flying I would suggest downlading your favourite shows or movies beforehand. USB charger ports were not working in my friends seat, so he had to use mine, while my entertainment screen buttons were broken (physically broken). Overall I would not fly with Air India again unless I have no other option.

There is more room between seats and the width of the seat is wider. Food is okay, booze plentiful and wide choice. No Noise Reducing headphones, which is normal in Business Class. They do not have their own Airport lounge but at Heathrow share the Lufthansa lounge which is nice.

After departure, lunch service had commenced and as this was a domestic flight, Air India serves only vegetarian options and so had a meal of paneer masala and rice with dal. For dessert a sweet dish of barfi was provided. The food was excellent. After lunch, tea was served.

Tissue paper and other garbage on the floor, no one bothered to clean it. After two hours, I returned and the toilet was in the same condition. This is simply unacceptable. Business Class toilet ran out of tissue and no one bothered to refill it. It was empty throughout the flight. Again this is simply outrageous. My entertainment system did not work at first. I reported this to one of the attendants and he restarted and it seemed to work. But in the end, the Flight Map was still broken. There were no meal menu given to us during this trip. The meals were verbally communicated to us. I paid $US2,000 only to be told what is in my meals. I had two small meals during this flight and each time I completed my meal the tray was not picked up in a timely fashion. I think I must have waited 25 minutes after I finished my meal, for the tray to be picked up. The flight attendants did not walk down the aisle as often as I think they should. Service was not a top priority for this set of crew. Meals were warm although I've had better economy international food than Air India's business class.

After an hour or so, flight attendants served drinks (eg. orange juice, water, whiskey) and peanuts. I opted for the non veg option for lunch which was lamb curry with rice along with salad, a bun and kheer for dessert. The food was excellent. The IFE entertainment had a good collection of movies (Hollywood/ Bollywood) and TV shows.

Upon waking up, a second round of food and drinks service started and watched a Hollywood movie. The non veg option contained chicken and rajma with rice, salad and gulab jamun.

Once reached the NY airport, was asked to find a connection flight on my own from DEL. I had to put up an hour's argument to prove my point that its a last minute cancellation and would be difficult for me to rebook a flight from Delhi and it being after 7PM will be even more difficult to find any local flights. Now, I am not sure if i can take the risk of flying back in Air India as the last minute cancellations seems to be pretty common for them and asked them to cancel the return trip and process the refund. its been 7 days since i made multiple calls and haven't heard from them yet.

Boarded the plane and we sat there with the In-Flight Entertainment not working for an hour and a half. We had to remind the flight attendant to turn it on. The screen though is massive, and there is a wide variety of movies in HD in English and Indian. This is probably because of their new 787 Dreamliner which is very nice. The seats recline a lot and the windows are all tinted blue the whole flight so the plane isn't to bright. We got served a Indian lamb or chicken dish. Very authentic Indian food along with very nice Indian flight attendants. IFE stayed on the whole flight and they server a breakfast of chicken and falafel which was very good.

Couple Leisure,Business Class,Delhi to Chicago,2017-02-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,0,2.0,"  I have no complaint about the service we received on our flight other than the entertainment system was somewhat hard to use and that my husband could find no classical music which he usually enjoys listening to on long haul flights. My complaint is about the ground personnel for Air India in Delhi. Due to a mechanical problem on our flight from Kolkata we missed our connection to a Lufthansa flight in Delhi. Lufthansa could not help us book a new flight and told us that Air India had to do it. When we finally made our way to the Air India booking desk there was a mob at the desk, not an organized queue. Would it be too much to put up some ropes so that people could queue and be helped in an orderly manner? When we finally got the attention of a person at the desk she said we had to contact Lufthansa in order to rebook which was the opposite of what Lufthansa told us. She gave us a voucher for a hotel and told us to contact Lufthansa in the morning. It was now 5 am. The hotel was horrible. It looked to be still under construction. It was cold and in a noisy neighborhood. The breakfast was awful. We could not reach Lufthansa with the phone numbers that Air India had given us the night before so we had to head back to the airport after getting less than three hours of sleep. This time there was no mob in front of the Air India booking desk but the man who helped us was interrupted 10 times while serving us. He told us he needed a ticket number to rebook the flight. Why didn't the Air India woman the previous night tell us this? After we provided him with that number it took him 2 hours to make the new booking. Then we had 13 hours to wait for our flight with no comfortable place to wait since we were told we could not access the Business Class Lounge until 4 hours before our flight. When we were finally allowed to check in for the flight the personnel at the Air India Business Class desk could only be described as surly. I find it difficult to believe that Air India truly wants its employees to treat passengers especially those who have paid a premium to fly in business class to be treated so poorly.",Spicejet,2017,2

We booked Air India for our trip from the UK to Goa because they offered the most convenient connection through Mumbai with minimal stopover time. It also offered very good value for money. Then I read the very negative reviews on this site and began to wish we hadn't. However our experience was very positive. This review is of the Mumbai to London long haul leg but it equally applies to our outbound leg. The connection at Mumbai is rather chaotic and involves a lot of different people stamping boarding cards and luggage labels to no good purpose after our internal flight from Goa. We then had a short wait in the terminal before the gate showed as open. There were no announcements at the gate then suddenly it was a hurry for everyone to board at once. No seat row priority. However we were near the front of economy so that wasn't a problem. Seats in economy on the 787 have comparatively generous legroom and are slightly wider than normal. Overall very comfortable with quite a lot of recline if you want it, and a foot rest if you have short legs. The flight was all in daylight, taking off at 07.00 and landing 11.30 (local times). The 787's electronic window blinds were effective in reducing solar glare and the cabin lighting made for a restful experience. IFE had a good range of Hollywood and Bollywood films, with a few recent releases and some older Hoclassics. TV channels in English were exclusively American shows, some well known comedies but the rest very mediochre. The audio channel has no western music, best bring your own. A map is available with various view options. On the outbound flight the touchscreen was problematic but inbound it worked perfectly. We had two full meals on this ten hour flight. A full hot breakfast soon after we took off and hot lunch a couple of hours before landing. It's a long time since I've had such good good on a long haul, full service carrier. Usually you get one meal and a snack. Drinks were served (with peanuts) some while before lunch. No more alcoholic drinks were offered but they were available from the galley if you asked. We had opted for a standard meal, which on Air India means some kind of curry. I found it tasty and well spiced without being overpowering. They had in fact run out of the non-veg lunch option by the time we were served but we were given a vegetarian curry with a seperate side dish of chicken curry. Excellent service. On many airlines you would just have to put up with what was left. Tea and coffee were served after lunch (tea first). Cabin crew offered water regularly throughout the flight to keep passengers hydrated. Despite this being a day flight the cabin lighting was kept dim and I was able to get several hours sleep.. Several reviews here comment on the bad state of the toilets. There were no such problems on either of our flights. Everything was as clean as any western airline. I suppose you might have a bad experience going into a toilet after someone has been ill, or made a mess, but that can happen on any airline. Air India has just as high standards of cleanliness as any other major carrier. In one sense Air India is like travelling back in time. The in flight service is old school full service. Nothing is skimped. Even the in flight magazine has interesting and well written articles to read, it isn't just a shopping catalogue. Cabin crew were uniformly courteous and helpful. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Air India again, especially on the 787.",Spicejet,2017,3

Events as follows: 1) Outbound flight Mumbai to Goa - scheduled itinerary change, ie the flight was moved back - this didn't cause me a massive problem but was symptomatic of further issues ahead. 2) Return flight Goa to Mumbai - frequent scheduled itinerary change emails and an email for me to change to an earlier flight (by 13hrs). The changes reduced the window for my connecting flight back to the UK, however Air India said I would still catch the flight ok. Flight was actually delayed by 3 hours, consequently I missed my flight back to London. Air India said that because the flights were bought on different tickets they would not get me home. Additional flight purchased to London as a result. My hold luggage got to Mumbai but has been lost, hence, I have no hesitation in rating as Air India as a 1/10 and have since learned they are notorious, please be warned and do not be attracted by their headline cheap flights.

Air India did a poor job of queue management both times. Even though they announced boarding by row, they still let anyone board regardless of seat number. This is especially frustrating because the predominantly indian crowd on either flight seemed to enjoy pushing their way through while ignoring the line of people actually waiting patiently. The seats were uncomfortable and didn't have enough cushioning especially when reclined. It felt like you were sitting on metal when the seat was reclined. This made a 14 hour flight almost painful. The bathrooms were just gross. In the first flight, there was pee on the bathroom floor that did not get cleaned up for the entire flight. The 'cleaning' by flight attendants involved regularly spraying air freshener in the lavatories. On the return flight, there wasn't even a soap dispenser! The soap was in a plastic water bottle with a crude hole punched on the top. The entertainment options were a coin toss. On one of the flights, the TV simply did not work even after they tried to reset it multiple times. On the flight that it did actually work, the entertainment options in English were limited and outdated. On the plus side however, there were 3 meal services (United only does 2 on a similar length flight). And the food tasted decent. Not good, but not bad either.",Spicejet,2017,3

Really stressful! My son was starving and already to tired to eat. Luckily I ordered a bassinet in advance for the whole flight. When we arrived in Delhi we had a 3 hours stopover.

One of the bags came in the mail but we waited one week for the other two and ultimately had to go to Newark airport to retrieve the bags as the airline employees had left the bags with no feeling of accountability and were not apologetic at all.

Onboard the aircraft looked tired. Flight landed 20 mins early. The best part of the flight was possibly the seat leg room and pitch which were generous for economy class and make a huge difference on a long haul flight. IFE is poor particularly if you are not Indian. I was shocked that the music channels were exclusively Indian - I mean not a single English channel. Drinks service - choice of beverages was poor. Dinner main course was one of the tastiest airline food I've had but portions were tiny. Starter and dessert poor. Breakfast was a joke - a small bowl of fruit and 2 cheap mini croissants. Tea was great. If you do not like curry, make sure to book a continental meal (Air India offer western meal as a special meal that can be pre-booked). Cabin crew were courteous and did a good job. A passenger complained of breathlessness and I saw crew provide timely attention. A flight attendant serving me had a genuine smile, helping out an elderly couple who seemed to be a bit frazzled by the flying experience. ",Spicejet,2016,11

Having read the other reviews online, which are less than flattering, I booked with hesitation. Overall, the experience wasn't nearly as horrifying as I'd expected. The flight was comfortable, the seat and legroom was great (and I'm over 6 feet tall); Economy class has an amazing seat pitch on the Air India Dreamliner. Since my flight arrived in Delhi in the evening, and the connecting flight to Paris left in the afternoon the following day, I got a hotel voucher when I departed Sydney (mind you, I had to specifically ask for it at the gate). Customs at Delhi is fussy, and it all feels quite rushed and disorderly, but the hotel room was comfortable and came with dinner, breakfast and lunch included (again, they don't tell you this, but if you ask, you can have all three). Service onboard was absolutely awful on the SYD–DEL leg, but acceptable on the other three legs of the full journey. Flight attendants on the first leg were rude, cold, unfriendly, was absolutely unprofessional. Entertainment options are pretty average; ugly UI and a dismal range of options, but I had my iPad to keep me busy. Food was great from Sydney to Delhi, but every other journey was pretty poor. Cold rock-hard bread buns, meat of questionable origin, and sometimes I just got asked ""vegetarian or non-vegetarian?"" with no clue what I was actually going to eat. Snacks between meals are a no-go, only peanuts and water / juice / coca-cola, which are self-serve while the FAs were just sitting in the galley reading a book. At the time, I paid ~NZ$1600 return to Paris from Auckland, but at that price, I probably wouldn't fly with them again. However, I see a similar offering from Sydney to Frankfurt for a trip next year at NZ~$1200 and to be honest, I'd probably fly with them again since the price is really cheap.

I had to watch the other passengers board and the flight depart, even though I had my ticket and passport handy. What followed was an ordeal. I waited for an hour before anyone contacted me to help me go back through security, immigration, and get my luggage back. The Air India ground crew were a mixture of sympathetic and completely uncaring. It seemed impossible to speak to the same staff member twice, and no one actioned anything unless I pushed and pushed. After 4 hours, I finally managed to clear customs and security. They made me rebook the flight for approximately US$300. I then handed my passport to the check-in counter manager and waited for my luggage. After an hour, I spoke to a new staff member, who clarified that nothing had been done yet. The lady I spoke to initially clearly didn't initiate any effort to get my luggage for me. This process was repeated three times, each time speaking with someone else. The last person I spoke to couldn't even tell me who had my passport by this stage, asking me if I knew who I gave it to, which was outrageous.

We chose air india for our flight from Sydney to the UAE as we wanted to spend our star alliance miles. I am glad having spent only miles, would have felt much worse if we would have paid full for the flight. We had a comparably modern Boeing 787 but on our initial flight one of the in-seat monitors was broken. Business class was quite empty so we could change seats. On our next flight, one of the remote controls was broken, so another change of seats. This time it was only one of the headphones which was broken, and could be replaced. You could say we had bad luck, but we got the clear impression that the crew wasn't really interested in the malfunctions. And I doubt they noted them in the logbook for future repair. We had booked special menus, ""vegan"" to be precise. Now, usually our expectations are low, but with an airline from a country where there are hundreds of millions vegetarians, what should go wrong? They seems to think that butter and Greek yoghurt are not animal products, and the vegan main dishes were the most primitive and tasteless we had in a long while. The service on board might be a cultural difference (this is more a hint for others than a criticism), but the crew is hardly offering anything without being explicitly asked for it. So don't expect anyone to come and bring you a bottle of water during your 13hr flight. Don't be shy and ping them again and again. We saw other (Indian) passengers doing this all the time. The entertainment system : I don't remember any other airline with so few and so old movies in the catalog. Funny enough : two of them were Christmas movies - in April. For the Germans, some titles come with German audio, but you won't find them in the menu under ""German"" but have to try-and-error the English movies. Only once you select ""Play"" there are sometimes German audio tracks offered. We were very disappointed.

Now it was time to come back to Canada. Our flight was confirmed from Mumbai to Dubai. Halt for 2 hrs in Dubai and then Air Canada from Dubai to Toronto. All seemed simple, but when we went to Mumbai airport (4hrs prior to our departure time), we were told that Air India will not fly us to Dubai because ""they got message from Air Canada in Dubai, that we may miss our flight as our halt in Dubai is only 2hrs and there won't be other flight for next 24hrs"". My son from Toronto, called Air Canada (same time we were still at the Mumbai Airport) and they confirmed it was a lie. Only to found out later that Air India overbooked their Dubai flight and looked every excuse in the book to keep us back. They tried to fly us thru London, UK and asked my son to Call Air Canada to arrange for our flight from London to Toronto. When my son called Air Canada, they confirmed that Air India is lying and it's their responsibility (as an operating airline) to get us to our destination. They wouldn't even offer us a hotel in Mumbai. No meals. Even dared to offer us refund and find our own way back home! Their plan was to strand us in Mumbai without being responsible for anything! After long arguments, they finally put us on Lufthansa (7 hrs after our original departing time) but made sure they informed Lufthansa not to issue us a wheel chair. I am 75 and my wife is 67. I just had knee surgery and they could clearly see we were struggling! ",Spicejet,2016,4

They used to be appalling onboard too, but I often used them because the timing suited me, and they offered the best seat comfort as compared to other airlines on this route, and they were often much cheaper. Service always suffered with indifference and bad training. On my last flight though, both in and out, the service and care was excellent.

Both flights on time, cabin announcements and safety seat belt warnings very good, have flown far worse and would say yes to flying again just preferably without a Mumbai layover for which such a new airport seriously lacks amenities of transit seating for such high passenger numbers and a transit hotel that should be located within the airport terminal and not something requiring a transit visa at outrageous and prohibitive prices for foreigners!",Spicejet,2015,12

The food was bland, a spinach-based curry which tasted awful, and their signature bad bread. The IFE didn't have a lot of options, but the interface itself was okay. The headphones were sub-standard and not up to the mark. This was a big disappointment, considering that it's a long-haul flight lasting just a little under 15 hours.

The cabin crew couldn't care less about the safety of the passengers because they didn't do a double check on the safety belts, and no restrictions on electronic devices were imposed.

There is barely any concept of good professional customer service. They don’t care about customer loyalty. This is even more evident with airlines as there is very little competition in the domestic sector that is now basically a duopoly between Indigo and Air India. I have had heaps of bad experiences with Air India and had to forego many flights when they change schedule. When they change schedule and it does not suit you they refuse to provide you a refund and you lose the money. I preferred Indigo as I found the service good and had no problems until recently. I had booked return flights IXC-JDH in early July to fly in late August. A week ago on checking my bookings on their app I found they had changed my inbound flight from JDH to IXC from a layover in JAI to DEL. No issue with that. However there was no message or email from the airline of the change. I just happened to find out while going through my booking on the app. Not only that, the timing was changed from 1125 to 0925 hours. Had I not checked I would have missed my flight. As the new time was not suitable to me I called the airline. I was able to change to a later time. However I was told I must pay a change fee of INR 2000 per ticket. You change schedule and expect the customer to pay for it? I explained to the agent that this is an Involuntary change and I must not have to pay for it. The agent put me on hold to get an authorisation. I was able to amend the time without having to cough up the unreasonable charge. In such instances the agents should not require to get authorisation. They should be authorised to amend without wasting time on either end. Now after a week, I find out they have once again made a schedule change. They have now moved my flight from JDH to 1450 from 1025. I will arrive in DEL at 1625. However they have not amended my connecting flight DEL-IXC. That is scheduled at 1505, which will land in IXC before I even arrive in DEL. So I am back on the phone to Indigo. I requested them to put me on their DEL-IXC flt at 1725. Once again they are unable to do that. Was advised they will check and call me back. Got a call they are unwilling to put me on that flight. They want me to take a 5 hour layover in Delhi and arrive in IXC at 2230 instead of my original booked flight at 1500 hours. I once again pleaded my case. Was told they will check call me again. Again refused, obviously that is a peak hour flight and they would rather sell at a premium and let us helpless passengers waste time at the transit airport. No empathy at all. There is no recourse, either take it or leave it. I find this totally unacceptable and very poor service. ",Spicejet,2024,8

They no longer provide fragile stickers, which is concerning for passengers with fragile items in their luggage. Additionally, considering it's an international flight, the basic fare does not include any complimentary meals or drinks. Even water is not provided unless specifically requested. The in-flight services are also overpriced, with a simple dish like poha costing over 300 rupees. Furthermore, there are no pillows or blankets provided, making the presence of five or six cabin crew members seem unnecessary if they are not providing any services.

Their claim was that it was in 2 baggages instead of a single one. I am a frequent flyer and this has never occurred in any of the airports before including Cochin for the same type of services.

The schedule of this flight is very unconfortable, making us impossible to have a hotel breakfast before boarding. We had 1 hour delay and not a single cabin announcement to explain it. The captain was unable to make any announcement except a brief incomprehensible announcement just before landing. The onboard entertainment was not working and we had to make the whole journey with a white screen, without any idea of the time and our position. The stewardesses distributed water generously, but instead of a meal, I received only a tiny portion of vegetable curry. I was so hungry that I had to rush into a turkish restaurant at the Istanbul airport. The stewardesses are nice, but they still wear the ridiculous ""Girl power"" badge.

Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Mumbai,2017-05-01,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,0,4.0,"  Delhi to Mumbai on Indigo Airbus A321. Had taken this evening flight and as we had checked in online, we went to the airport directly. However, it was observed that we still had to get a copy of the boarding pass from the check in kiosks which was surprising because normally with the online boarding passes, there should not be any need to get the printout from the kiosks. This issue was not observed in my previous flight with another airline. The flight was on time with just a slight 10 minute delay in departure. The seats onboard were slightly cramped and if someone has a slightly bigger frame, then comfort might be a difficulty. As this is a low cost carrier, meals and snacks such as sandwiches (both veg and non-vegetarian), tea/coffee and cup noodles were offered. As I had booked this flight with a corporate meal, a chicken sandwich and juice was offered 30 minutes after takeoff. The sandwich was a bit on the colder side but tasty nevertheless and the juice was also given in a can. After the snack, unfortunately the passenger in front of me had reclined his seat so as a result, it got even more cramped. To be fair to the crew, they were quite presentable and they performed their tasks with great efficiency. Flight was on time and while exiting the aircraft, the crew were quite polite and thanked the passengers. The positive was the crews friendly attitude and efficiency. On the downside perhaps it can be said that if one is of a bigger frame, the conditions can get slightly cramped and so on longer flights this can be a problem. Their in-flight magazine Hello 6E had some articles but was by and large, an in-shop magazine. Would I fly with them again? Maybe on very short routes which are dirt cheap, but would rather prefer the full service carriers instead.",Spicejet,2017,5

I prefer a low-cost flight on this route as the journey time is just 2 hrs. IndiGo is not a full-service carrier but one thing is for sure if you are booking an IndiGo flight be sure that you reach on time. They have a record of on time departures. The ground crew and cabin crew is well-trained and swift and helpful. The only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system. The magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in India for a vacation or a tour. The airline connects almost each and every airport of India. Also they are flying to some international destinations like Dubai. They also provide free reminder service for your flight and the communication system between airline and consumers is way too good.

Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amritsar to London Heathrow via Dubai,2024-02-01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0," SpiceJet proved to be incredibly disappointing and untrustworthy in my recent experience. Traveling with my family, a total of six individuals, we embarked on a journey from Amritsar (ATQ), India to DXB (Dubai) on February 24, 2024. The scheduled departure time was 08:40 AM, with a connecting flight from Dubai to London Heathrow at 14:30 Hrs via Emirates. Our ticket was booked through the booking.com portal as a single ticket, rather than separate bookings to facilitate the connection. However, our experience with SpiceJet quickly turned sour. Departing from ATQ, the flight was delayed by 55 minutes. Upon arrival in Dubai, we encountered further frustration as we remained onboard the aircraft for over an hour and a half without disembarkation. Initially, we were given excuses regarding weather conditions, despite the clear and sunny day in Dubai, and optimal weather conditions for take-off. Eventually, a member of the ground staff revealed the truth - the delay was due to SpiceJet's scheduling issues and the busy nature of Dubai airport. This delay resulted in us missing our connecting flight to London Heathrow. Expecting assistance from SpiceJet, we hurried to their counter hoping for a resolution. However, to our dismay, they refused to take responsibility or provide any alternative solutions. Their staff was unhelpful and dismissive, leaving us stranded in Dubai with our children. Consequently, we were forced to purchase new tickets at a staggering cost of £4061 to secure our journey back to the UK. I feel compelled to caution others against falling victim to this airline's deceptive practices.

We booked a direct flight from Mumbai to Jaisalmer with SpiceJet in June for the Xmas holidays. Come a week before the flight SpiceJet starts smsing and emailing us that there is no direct flight and we will need to choose an alternative flight with a connection in Delhi and 10 hour layover options. At such a last minute all airfares were exorbitant and it was impossible to rebook flights even if we took refund. We wrote to them asking for a hotel stay for the layover. This was denied too. They held on to our money for 6 months before doing this. This is not where the ordeal ends. The first flight was delayed. Sat on the runway for over an hour before take off. We had to rush and change terminals. We were assured that our suitcases would reach Jaisalmer with us by every flight attendant and their airport staff. They did not. We were stranded without our winter wear and suitcases for 2 days in Jaisalmer till our suitcases were given to us the next day. We were forced to spend thousands of rupees on new clothes for the entire family. We asked them to reimburse this amount too. They did not. We asked for our choice of sandwich as per their menu.

Later the flight got delayed by 3 hours and 30 mins without any proper notice, to my surprise while checking upon the same with the airlines ground staff they were completely clueless of why this flight is getting delayed.

The flight was scheduled to land at Shirdi at 4.50pm. Instead, the flight landed at Mumbai at 5.30pm. Announcement was made just before landing at Mumbai. Reason given was storm at Shirdi when actually there was no storm and 3 different flights from Chennai, Tirupati and Vizag (including one ATR) landed around the same time. This was confirmed from local authority at Shirdi. Passengers were in the aircraft for more than 3 hours in Mumbai, during this period there were only 2 announcements, 1st announcement after 1 hour of landing in Mumbai that flight will be taken to Nashik as it could not land in Shirdi after dark. 2nd announcement after 3.5 hours was that passengers were given 3 options: Option 1: stay at Mumbai for the night and go to Shirdi next day. Option 2: Go to Shirdi by bus. Option 3: Go back to Delhi and fly to Shirdi next day. There was utter confusion and no clarity. Passengers lost their patience and naturally got furious. We were deboarded in Mumbai airport around 9.00pm. It took one hour to collect the checked-in luggage as different ground crew announced different conveyor belt Nos (No 1,4,14 and finally 13). Ground staff signed and put stamp on the boarding pass of the passengers after writing full refund of the to ticket charges. On requesting for refund through mail, SpiceJet authorities refuse to refund citing the reason for rescheduling of flight (mail from SpiceJet attached). This is totally misleading information and mismanagement by SpiceJet treating their customers as fools and commodity. SMS/Mail from SpiceJet was about cancellation of the flight which was not correct. The loss of time, mental stress, fatigue and poor communication and misinformation by the Pilot can not be compensated in terms of money.

No service at all. The crew doesn’t provide proper snacks if you pay for it at time of booking the flight. At the time of snacks they gives you 2 biscuits and a 10 rupees juice. When we demanded tea or coffee they make lame excuses. They charge extra for luggage without checking their weight. Worst flight ever.

We paid for priority check in and Spice Max but we literally had to beg for all the services we were entitled to, in fact their staff asked us to get into the regular queues and wait saying there are no priority services, we literally had to fight for it.

So Chennai to Mumbai and Mumbai to Goa. The waiting time in Mumbai is 6+ hours. I wrote to customer relations, asking them, since there is no alternate flights available, its our daughters first birthday and she was so nagging and I requested them atleast provide a lounge or room considering the infant as it is 6+ hours. I got no response for that until 12th September. When you call customer care, one have to nearly wait 40+ minutes to speak to respective person in-charge. Again, via return, the direct flight has been cancelled. We took a flight from Goa to Bangalore and Bangalore to Chennai with 3+ hours waiting time in Bangalore.  There was a time change again, from Goa to Bangalore and we re-booked our cab. We had a very worst experience with Spicejet. All they say, the change is due to operational reasons.

Dont know why they charge so much money for such a worst service. I will never recommend using Spicejet ever to anyone. I had a worst experience ever with the airport staff.

We pleaded with to them but their attitude was so rude. After pleading for 20 mins they gave us boarding passes because we had already done online check in. After all this drama I finally boarded the flight 15 mins early, if they haven’t made this an issue I would have boarded half an hour earlier. I really recommend to please learn hospitality from other airlines, I also travelled with Vistara, Indigo, GoAir and Air India, if their customers are late they actually look for you and make you board the flight without making it an issue.

I never expected such care and warmth, she was very grounded and so real, not like she was doing her job.

I personally had a very bad headache that day and they helped me overcome that by providing excellent service. They were very polite (although I know it is their job). The steward was very kind to first ask me if I had taken food before getting me a pill and lukewarm water (this matters because medicines have to be taken after food and with lukewarm water and not every flight steward/stewardess bothers to make sure if the passenger has eaten something and if the temperature of the water is right). After this, the stewardess approached me a second time to enquire if I was doing okay and if I needed something which I thought was a very sweet and generous gesture from their side and I was so satisfied and happy because I had never received that kind of treatment on any flight before. I know it is the job of an air host/hostess to attend to the passengers, but to date, on every flight I've been to, none of them have come back to enquire about my health after attending to me once.

To my utter surprise, she asked another co-passenger, who was also having tea, whether his beverage was hot enough. He responded, might be, 'yes'. She then turned to me and said, he is saying the tea is hot enough. To my utter disbelief, she poured some water from the pot. I didn't say anything but kept the cup full of tea or to be precise some lukewarm water and a piece of biscuit. I could have argued that my co passenger purchased the beverage when she began serving and I purchased while she was coming back from one round. But I didn't say anything. But I wonder how could a lady pour some water, maybe to her belief hot enough, to the cup of tea without even thinking that what would be the taste of the beverage.

I paid 15k for my excess baggage and they did that for most passengers and later all of our baggage was left behind as they did not have enough space in the flight and no information was provided to us. They just keep making money by accepting all there is to take. Upon landing in Pune they informed us what they have done and delivered a lot of false promises about refunds and compensation to pacify us. Later when I followed up with their customer care they didn't even bother to reply; cause they know they have already got the money and later when I complained again they bluntly refused to pay any compensation or refunds. They are extremely unprofessional and liars and cheats.

I travelled all the way from the UK and Spicejet has managed to destroy my stay, why? I phoned the extremely unhelpful “helpline “some 5 times but they acted very unprofessional and were not helpful the slightest. I had all my very necessary belongings including my medicines in the luggage. There was no information anywhere re. Power bank restriction.  The check in staff could easily have either phoned me or called me through the airport speaking sound system. The Mumbai staff could have phoned the Cochin staff and informed them that my luggage was suspended in Mumbai rather than leaving me anxiously waiting for my luggage which never arrived. Spicejet staff could have been helpful and send my luggage to Cochin airport the same day. 5“Helpline” extremely Unhelpful at all times and never called me back for update. 6Finally when my luggage was sent to Cochin 3 very long and troublesome days later, my power bank was not in there. They could have easily put the power bank in the aircraft cabin. Spicejet said that they disposed of the power bank? My power was fairly new costed me £50 so surely someone is using it now.

The ticket price is not that cheap compared to other Indian airline, the story began when the flight was delayed for more than an hour without communication with us. After that, we boarded an old plane with nothing onboard - tight legroom, rude staff, A/C not working, toilet disgusting etc. Luckily, the flight was not that and was still able to made in to my flight at 10 pm to get on my flight to SE Asia via Dubai. My advice - don't travel on Spicejet if you can help. Try and fly another airline whenever possible.",Spicejet,2018,9

New aircraft and clean interior and toilets. I paid Rs 300 for chicken meal and was good.  Low fare as one way cost me Rs 5500 incl tax $80 approx. with 30kgs checking and 7 kgs baggage. Seats were average. The  crew were very busy on the flight selling foods and beverages. One flight attendant seemed tired and frustrated and yelled at any passenger who called from service at times. I felt extra crew member or relaxed flight attended could have made the service better. No inflight entertainment. I will fly again.

We were travelling from Dubai to Amritsar on 21st April and had especially booked spicemax as we needed increased leg space and priority check in as we had an infant with us - but we were utterly disappointed when we got to know in the flight itself that there were no spicemax seats and the food my husband ordered was finished already. For all 4 of us the journey was disastrous and we were just fidgeting in the small seats and my son was irritated with congested space. We were not told by any of the staff nor did we receive any email regarding non-availablity of the spicemax seats. This didn't happen once but both ways we were travelling. ,Spicejet,2018,5

Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Goa to Delhi,2018-01-01,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,0,1.0,"  We were supposed to fly from Goa to Delhi in order to get our connection flight to Belgrad (Serbia). Our time in Delhi should have been 3 hours which was considered more than enough to catch our next flight. After the boarding was over and all the passengers were already on the plane, Spicejet allowed a group of people standing on the plane stares to literally stop the plane from departing. No one announced us what was going on, even though we asked several questions and insisted that most of the passengers have other flight connections to catch in Delhi. At some point, a stewardess told us that the people from the stairs insisted that the plane has to wait for another two people to join the flight. No clarification was brought to us. It is still unclear if Spicejet sold more tickets than the available ones in the plain, or the group of Indian people making the scandal considered is their right to stop the plane until two more friends will join, but it doesn't matter. What matters is that the crew did nothing, but waited for 1,5 hours after the boarding was finished. The passengers asked them to call the police or the airport security but nothing happened for 1,5 hours. It was a huge chaos. At some point, many passengers, tourist mainly step out of the plane, arguing with the group of people who wanted to stop the plane for departing. No reaction again from the Spicejet crew. Due to this delay, many passengers from the plane lost our connection flights and had to pay a substantial amount of money to change our flight tickets. Please be your own judge if it is acceptable that in 2017 companies like Spicejet should exist on the market?",Spicejet,2018,1

To be honest, I am a bit of a patron when it comes to SpiceJet. I have lived through the worst phase of the airline in 2014 when cancellations were more common than on-time flights. However, what has struck me over the last 2 years is the transformation that the airline has seen. While most of us would assume that one man cannot weave magic, Mr. Ajay Singh seems to have done precisely that. The flights take off on time, the planes are clean as a classroom, the food is served hot and the crew are courteous. The long queues at the airport seem to magically disappear without any halla-bulla! Yet it is affordable for middle-class blokes like me. Wonder what the SpiceJet formula is! This is almost surreal!",Spicejet,2017,6
Family Leisure,Economy Class,Pune to Dubai,2017-12-01,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,0,3.0," Pune to Dubai. SpiceJet, as you may know is a low budget airline, but who knew in this case that low budget means lowest quality? My family and I started our return flight back to Dubai with discomfort, for our seats were positioned directly in front of the emergency exit doors. So whilst we couldn't recline our seats, those in front of us could. Let me just say this resulted in little to no room for sitting, reading, or even for that matter sleeping. To provide a more visual description we were literally trapped in our seats, so if you get claustrophobic either pray you get a better seat or better yet I would recommend avoiding the flight itself. This dissatisfaction didn't stop there. The food which my sister and I had specifically pre ordered due to our dietary constraints (paleo) and already paid for was not available. As we couldn't eat any of the other meals available, we had to order 2-3 other meals and scrape at whatever we would be able to eat, which wasn't a lot as the portion sizes were extremely small, in comparison to the food available at the airport which we didn't consume due to the fact that our pre-ordered meals would be served on the plane. This review is specifically targeting SpiceJet's management and organization, not its cabin crew who were in fact very helpful with providing additional meal alternatives for us. It's a shame to think that these issues could have easily been avoided if my family and I had been informed of our seating locations prior to boarding. Sadly SpiceJet's management found it too difficult to pick up a phone to inform us about our seat arrangements and the unavailability of our meal options.",Spicejet,2017,12

My flights were on time and in fact we arrived 5-10 minutes before the actual arrival time. Spicejet takes great pride in having this record of completing flights before time. However, the cabin left much to be desired for. On our flight from Dhaka to Kolkata there was water leaking through the light overhead. The cabin crew were generous enough to wipe them when requested and provided tissue papers. There is no food unless you pay for it. We did not try their menu. The cabin crew were fairly polite. If you are strictly in need of getting from point A to B at the cheapest cost then give Spicejet a go. Do not expect any bells and whistles though.",Spicejet,2017,9
